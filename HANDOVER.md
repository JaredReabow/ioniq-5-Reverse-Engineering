# HANDOVER — IONIQ 5 Gen5W research

Updated **2026-11-08**. The recovered authentic Hyundai/LG launcher chain now
passes the standby/profile-confirm gate and visibly foregrounds authentic
`AppHomeScreen` in the local VM. Authentic AppNavi map pixels still render
separately. The remaining integration goal is stable Home↔Navigation operation,
followed by stateful service/CAN/persistence reconstruction.

#### From the parallel repository

The parallel repository last stamped this handover **2026-10-28** with the same
opening paragraph. Every section it carries is present below; the newer dated
checkpoints from this lineage stay first, as they are the later findings.

## Direct SMACK `Privileged` exec-transition checkpoint — 2026-11-09

- A strict canonical-policy audit found 27 distinct `App::* -> _` rules and all
  grant both read and execute. The stock relabel contract assigns ordinary
  label `_` and `SMACK64EXEC=Privileged` to
  `/etc/update_start_5w.sh.ori`; setup writes `Privileged` to `onlycap`.
- Linux v4.1 checks the pre-transition task label against the inode's ordinary
  access label, separately performs read admission during open, then places the
  execute label in proposed credentials. Script-interpreter preparation
  preserves that selected label; the ELF loader commits it before all later
  loader work has necessarily completed.
- This supports a direct configured `App::* -> Privileged` transition candidate
  independent of V-028 and the session bus. It is not a UID escalation:
  capability masks remain separate, and `onlycap=Privileged` supplies eligibility
  at `smack_privileged()` call sites only when the task also has the applicable
  effective capability.
- Exact Bash/glibc identities establish secure-loader removal of named dangerous
  variables, UID/GID-based Bash privileged-mode semantics, ordinary environment
  import, guarded environment-function import, and PATH-based lookup. The stock
  anchor does not reset PATH and performs an unqualified lookup, but runtime
  environment influence and command execution remain unobserved.
- Added `tools/uk_fw/smack_privileged_exec_chain.py` version `1.3.0`, focused
  tests, `evidence/smack-privileged-exec-chain.md`, and deterministic report
  SHA-256 `c4cfa148c93a437ce3eb87656c6d7458e4c7b3869c9270be33c28df5933b46cf`.
  The first independent review required explicit alias/link/special-node tests
  and analyzer-owned archive/descriptor helpers. The second required a
  hash-bound x86-64 `EXTRA_UNSECURE_ENVVARS` definition and explicit single-dot
  archive coverage. Both rounds were remediated; a third fresh, strictly
  read-only review returned `ACCEPTED` with no P0–P2 findings. Focused validation
  passes 15 tests; the complete suite passes 891 tests and 351661 subtests. No
  target execution, payload, D-Bus request, label change, update, flash, or
  persistence action occurred.

## App-domain to persistence boundary checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Extended the configured AppLauncher result through Linux capability, SMACK,
  storage, update-trust, slot, and boot-acceptance gates. Upstream Linux v4.1
  and the recovered exact `cap_bprm_set_creds` range support a configured
  prediction of broad permitted/effective capability inheritance for UID-zero
  AppLauncher/app children absent a separate runtime reduction.
- This does not make floor `_` unrestricted root. Recovered setup assigns
  `onlycap=Privileged`; capability bits alone do not make a floor task eligible
  for SMACK override. V-028 remains a conditional same-UID `App::* → _`
  domain-amplification path with explicit access to enumerated app domains.
- The recovered kernel lacks dm-verity, IMA appraisal, EVM, and module-signature
  enforcement, but root mount writability, useful labeled objects, authenticated
  final bytes, inactive-slot selection, ABL/MICOM acceptance, health,
  mark-good, rollback, and recovery remain unproved. The OEM private signing key
  is not supplied by rootfs access.
- Extended the passive disconnected-bench collector to record process PPid,
  `CapInh/CapPrm/CapEff/CapBnd/CapAmb`, optional `NoNewPrivs`, `Seccomp`, four security
  sysctls, launcher-chain hashes, and launcher/systemd/relabel/`/tmp` SMACK
  xattrs. Focused synthetic validation passed `25 tests, 20 subtests`; the full
  suite passed `876 tests, 351661 subtests` in `122.06s`. Emitted probe size is
  `25651` bytes and SHA-256 is
  `5fc8ed5d80073ef8aa19fa3a82505d97db1e06baef33320c9c0aad94127d7c6b`.
- Added `evidence/app-domain-to-persistence-chain.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/application-candidates/app-domain-to-persistence-exact-static.txt`.
  The requested Fable and DeepSeek native routes remain unavailable; no
  substitute reviewer or external private disclosure was used. No target
  execution, D-Bus request, write, update, flash, or persistence action
  occurred.

## BusyBox unsafe-filename applicability checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Public-source comparison identified BusyBox commit
  `8c06bc6ba14949d945eff0abcabab885f1ef7680` (`unzip: prevent attacks via
  malicious filenames`). It is not an ancestor of release `1_23_2` and is
  present beginning with `1_24_0`; preserved patch SHA-256 is
  `6110c8337bf4115c9d581a3b5af21ebc6e3aaf7193ce2b38989c7edaa878cb73`.
- Exact-route review rejects path traversal through this defect in AppScomoDM's
  command. The command supplies literal inclusion names `AppUpgrade` and
  `.lge.upgrade.xml`; stock BusyBox passes each raw local-header name to
  `fnmatch(pattern, member, 0)` and skips an unmatched entry before directory,
  `stat`, output-open, or decompression handling. Absolute, parent-prefixed,
  component-prefixed, and trailing-traversal names therefore fail this caller's
  inclusion filter.
- This is intentionally separate from V-020/CVE-2015-9261. Compressed data for
  an accepted literal member still reaches the pre-fix method-8 Huffman parser
  before either AppScomoDM verifier. Other unzip callers, pre-existing output
  objects, output-directory identity, and filesystem races remain unresolved.
- Added
  `evidence/busybox-unzip-unsafe-filename-applicability.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/update-candidates/busybox-unzip-unsafe-filename-exact-static.txt`.
  No archive, malformed filename, payload, target execution, filesystem write,
  D-Bus request, update, commit, or push occurred.

## AppLauncher configured privilege-chain checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- A stable no-follow scan of canonical `mango-rootfs.tar.gz` found `66836`
  members consisting only of regular files, symlinks, and directories, with no
  PAX/xattr/SMACK record. Mutable extraction metadata is not used for the xattr
  conclusion.
- The stock rootfs relabel flow recursively removes access/execute attributes,
  then restores `SMACK64EXEC` for fixed application lists. `AppUpgrade` is
  restored as `App::upgrade`; `AppLauncher`, its script, systemd, and init are
  omitted. This ordered delete-then-restore sequence predicts no executable
  label on the launcher chain.
- Exact recovered-kernel instructions confirm that the initial task receives
  the floor label, a null inode execute-label pointer leaves the inherited task
  label unchanged at exec, new inodes begin with the creator label absent
  transmutation, and `smack_privileged` requires both the capability and the
  `onlycap` label match. Recovered setup writes `Privileged` to `onlycap`.
- Both Dbuslaunch and ApplicationLauncher are configured without `User=`,
  `Group=`, or `SmackProcessLabel=`. AppLauncher imports no direct credential-
  dropping API. Combined with reciprocal `App::* ↔ _` rules and V-028, a
  delivered successful direct-route exec of an app-created file without
  `SMACK64EXEC` is predicted to retain configured uid zero and transition from
  the caller's `App::*` domain to launcher floor `_`.
- This is not unrestricted SMACK root. A compromised stock app is already
  configured uid zero and has `App::* → _` access; the incremental result is a
  predicted floor task label and access to other enumerated application domains.
  Runtime Request registration/delivery, exec, credentials/capabilities, labels,
  `Privileged`, update-anchor writes, boot acceptance, and persistence remain
  unproved.
- Added `evidence/applauncher-configured-privilege-chain.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/application-candidates/applauncher-configured-privilege-chain-exact-static.txt`.
  No D-Bus request, executable, payload, target execution, write, commit, or push
  occurred.

## Navigation observability/threaded-comparison checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Read-only review compared the retained integrated basic/deadline script (349
  lines, SHA-256
  `906e734012a9a9cac35aed2e9258674215b407a93cdce9e58024a2f78bf8dd9f`) with
  the threaded pointer-confirm script (199 lines, SHA-256
  `004c4d47f4271301ecc88ea2676eb0fc9ad0a0116dc44327b8e0878259f4e6f7`).
  The latter is not a valid stock integrated Navigation comparison: it
  bind-mounts modified `/AppNavi-egl-no-msaa-v2`, changes llvmpipe/two workers to
  softpipe/one, uses a different Standby observation overlay, omits the AppNavi
  compatibility opt-ins and launcher-local liveness preload, and never performs
  the Home→Navigation or explicit Navigation→Home segment.
- A valid future comparison must preserve the integrated script's authentic
  AppNavi, graphics settings, QML overlays, timing controls, genuine manager
  messages, observation windows, and explicit Home return. A global
  `QSG_RENDER_LOOP=threaded` also changes every descendant Qt Quick process, so
  its scope must be disclosed; no AppNavi-only wrapper, modified interposer, or
  replacement runner was created.
- Child stderr routing is now resolved statically. In exact AppLauncher process-
  start body `[0x163f0,0x18550)`, ID 30 is not among the ID-mask exceptions
  17/22/40, and its ordinary construction field is 1 rather than the value-2
  exemption. The path sends `/dev/null` to
  `QProcess::setStandardOutputFile` at `0x16fbd` and
  `QProcess::setStandardErrorFile` at `0x17007`. Client-side
  `WAYLAND_DEBUG` is therefore predicted to be discarded rather than inherited
  by `launcher.log`.
- The integrated runner also exports `WAYLAND_DEBUG=1` after Weston has already
  started, so it does not enable server-side protocol tracing there. The least
  intrusive future observation is bounded compositor-side protocol logging,
  correlated to IVI surface 3000, for a genuine null attach/commit. That can
  prove the protocol-visible terminal effect but not directly prove internal
  `WM_Obscure` or `doneCurrent` execution; those remain exact-static links.
- Added a two-route comparison matrix: direct Linux foreground hide requires a
  true base result, screen 1/2/4, and false foreground; queued visibility uses
  the bounded type-`0x103` same-state producer, returns false from the base
  producer, and later hides in `dispatchNotifyEvent`. Their distinct diagnostics
  are required because the shared `onVisibleChanged(false)` callback identifies
  neither route.
- No guest or target execution, D-Bus request, compositor event, image change,
  runner, operational interposer, commit, or push occurred. See
  `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/application-candidates/navigation-hide-backend-exact-static.txt`.

## Navigation hide-producer checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- The recovered AppNavi has exactly two direct calls to its `QWindow::hide()`
  import: `0x3362275` in `NimoExSLScreenLinux::onForeground(bool,bool)` and
  `0x3365140` in
  `NimoExSLScreenLinux::dispatchNotifyEvent(ExSLNotifyEvent const*)`.
- Corrected the direct foreground branch. Linux `onForeground` calls the Nimo
  base at `0x3361e27`, which reaches `ExSLScreen::onForeground` at `0x33712c3`.
  The Linux direct hide branch requires that base result to be true, then admits
  only screen IDs 1, 2, or 4 and a false logical foreground argument.
- Recovered the second authentic visibility route. On a bounded Gen5/platform
  same-state branch, `ExSLScreen::onForeground` constructs event type `0x103`,
  copies the requested Boolean into its value field, and queues it to the same
  screen at `0x2607af7`. Linux `dispatchNotifyEvent` consumes type `0x103`; zero
  calls hide and nonzero calls show. Its format string is
  `setVisible screenId(%d) value(%d)`. The local producer returns false, so the
  direct Linux hide is skipped and queued dispatch is a distinct route.
- `SessionInteraction::setForegroundStatus` has six recovered direct callers.
  Only the `SessionInteraction::updateServiceState` call at `0x1c3bca7` passes
  `beforeNotify=false`; the other five pass true. Retained `beforeNotify(0)`
  messages are consistent with that event-update path among direct callers, but
  do not prove the runtime callsite or exclude indirect invocation.
- Retained ordering materially narrows runtime provenance. Weston sends AppNavi
  FG at `00:04:02.050`, AppNavi logs `onVisibleChanged(false)` at
  `00:04:02.071`, and ApplicationManager logs status 5/window 0 at
  `00:04:02.198`. The first retained `setForegroundStatus` change is later at
  `00:04:04.585` for screen 6/true; later false calls concern screens 9, 6, and
  10. No retained primary-screen false call or direct-hide diagnostic exists.
  The first-false callback's one-shot launch notification precedes the retained
  manager status, so hide/false visibility is upstream of status 5; later
  authentic BG can use the manager's cached-status replay.
- Therefore waiting only for `NimoExSLScreenLinux::onForeground(false,...)` was
  too narrow. Future passive evidence must distinguish the direct foreground
  hide from type-`0x103` event handling and then observe threaded
  `WM_Obscure → doneCurrent → EGL invalidation → BG`. The false-visibility
  callback alone still proves neither producer nor backend invalidation.
- This was read-only exact-static/saved-log analysis. No guest, target, D-Bus,
  compositor event, image mutation, synthetic status/BG, commit, or push was
  performed. See `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/application-candidates/navigation-hide-backend-exact-static.txt`.

## Navigation EGL/render-loop checkpoint — 2026-11-07

- The primary AppNavi surface-class ambiguity is closed. The
  `NimoExSLScreenLinux` constructor (`0x335b080`) constructs `QQuickView`;
  `QQuickWindowPrivate::init` (`0x1b0160`) sets the render-loop surface type,
  and recovered `QSGRenderLoop::windowSurfaceType()` (`0x178680`) returns
  OpenGL. AppLauncher/Weston independently bind this primary Qt Quick window to
  surface `3000`. It is therefore the Wayland EGL path, not Shm.
- `NimoExSLScreenLinux::onForeground(bool,bool)` contains an authentic
  `QWindow::hide()` call at `0x3362275`, and constructor connections bind
  `visibleChanged(bool)` to `onVisibleChanged(bool)` at `0x335be80`. The later
  2026-11-08 checkpoint adds the second direct hide at `0x3365140` and corrects
  the producer focus: retained false visibility does not identify either hide
  invocation.
- `QQuickWindow::hideEvent` (`0x1aa7d0`) dispatches render-loop slot `+0x68`.
  The retained integrated Home→Navigation runs under diagnosis force
  `QSG_RENDER_LOOP=basic`; basic-loop
  vtable relocation `0x60fd48` resolves that slot to `0x178730`. The exact body
  only reaches `sceneGraphAboutToStop`/`fireAboutToStop()`. It does not call
  `QOpenGLContext::doneCurrent()`, invalidate EGL, or detach a Wayland buffer.
- The threaded route differs materially. Threaded relocation `0x61dfc0`
  resolves hide to `0x1802a0`; public QtDeclarative v5.4.1 maps exposed-window
  hide to `WM_Obscure`, whose recovered sequence calls `doneCurrent` at
  `0x1831f6` and clears the active window at `0x1831fb`.
- The recovered backend edge is exact: QtGui `doneCurrent()` (`0x121380`) calls
  Wayland EGL context `0x6aa0`; platform-window slot `+0xf8`, relocation
  `0x20d630`, resolves to `0x82c0`. That vendor routine destroys the EGL
  surface when present, performs `attach(nullptr,0,0)`, commits, and flushes.
  This is the route capable of producing compositor zero-size/BG and the
  ApplicationManager window-latch replay.
- Therefore the forced basic loop is a harness-specific semantic mismatch and
  directly explains why authentic false visibility can coexist with no AppNavi
  BG in retained runs. It is not proof that a threaded full-chain run will
  complete Navigation: actual `WM_Obscure` execution, the mixed graphics stack,
  compositor delivery, setter replay, callbacks, ID `30`, and composition remain
  observational boundaries.
- The retained Home return was explicitly requested by event `302`, reason
  `322`; it was not an autonomous Navigation loading/fallback timeout. No
  synthetic BG, forced latch, fabricated status, guest execution, or image
  modification was used for this classification. See
  `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/application-candidates/navigation-hide-backend-exact-static.txt`.

## Navigation status/window consumer checkpoint — 2026-11-02

- Corrected the prior unresolved reading of
  `notifyNaviLaunched[5] window[0]`. In exact ApplicationManager callbacks,
  integer `5` is the **only accepted positive launch value**: both
  `NaviMapApplication` and `NaviMenuApplication` set their play-enable byte and
  enter controller-mediated handoff logic only for status 5. Other statuses
  clear the byte and return. The sender signal name containing `Fail` does not
  define the receiver's enum semantics.
- ApplicationManager identity remains size `3956056`, SHA-256
  `5d71539f61a3982b8aac6132a2de14c083fa9ac129792bae750a526ebd771cbc`,
  Build ID `fd5b023c1b1dcf0b5bc0f1e85e82226fb3da5c7f`. Unwind ranges are
  notification consumer `[0x287e70,0x28806c)`, window setter
  `[0x288070,0x28819b)`, map callback `[0x2c5900,0x2c5c4f)`, and menu callback
  `[0x2c5df0,0x2c613f)`.
- The consumer always caches status at `this+0x1c`, but a null controller or
  zero window byte at `this+0x20` stops before ID-30/ID-32 callbacks. Status 5
  with a nonzero window also clears two ID-35 loading-object lists, then invokes
  eligible map/menu callbacks. The window setter writes its input byte and
  replays cached status.
- The authentic BG callback calls the setter with literal 1. Therefore the
  observed pair is **accepted status blocked by an unset BG-driven latch**, not
  a two-field failure report. Saved runs still contain AppNavi FG but no AppNavi
  BG. A real BG/first-hide/unmap transition remains the integration blocker.
- The inspected routines contain no direct Home-ID-11 edge. The retained return
  was explicitly requested by event `302`, reason `322`, rather than being an
  autonomous loading/fallback timeout. Positive callback reachability also does
  not prove current/drawing ID 30 or composition because additional virtual
  predicates and controller dispatch remain.
- Named the recovered QtWayland hide discriminator. Public v5.4.1 defines
  `windowType()` as Shm=0/Egl=1. The recovered client performs its common
  explicit null-buffer commit only for zero/Shm; the EGL implementation returns
  1 and skips that block. The later 2026-11-07 checkpoint supersedes the then-
  open class question: surface 3000 is Qt Quick OpenGL/EGL, basic hide stops at
  `fireAboutToStop()`, and the threaded `doneCurrent` invalidation route is now
  exact-static.
- Updated `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md` and retained
  privacy-safe exact-static records at
  `evidence/artifacts/application-candidates/navigation-launch-consumer-exact-static.txt`
  and
  `evidence/artifacts/application-candidates/navigation-hide-backend-exact-static.txt`.
  No guest, recovered target, D-Bus request, compositor event, image, or updater
  was executed or modified; no synthetic BG/FG notification or status was used.

## AppFUMO `decryptionFile` producer-provenance checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Analysis began at requested HEAD
  `c886e103c9378cbc6f3884e738f4870bab7a3826`. During final validation, a
  five concurrent external commits advanced HEAD through `4dd644e37`,
  `332fc60cc`, `bb3fe7ba8`, and `f2f4bd215` to
  `1d5da8111b26a64d7efaff4c69e368f93bc7ec2c`. They changed only
  `Ioniq5-CHANGELOG.md`, `Ioniq5-HISTORY.md`, and
  `Ioniq5-VULNERABILITIES.md`; this audit did not create, stage, amend, reset,
  or push those commits. The pre-existing unrelated
  `tools/uk_fw/ias_backend_soft/micom_service.c` modification was not inspected
  or changed. During implementation and review, nothing was delegated, staged,
  committed, pushed, reset, or stashed; parent integration later staged exactly
  the 15 reviewed package paths.
- Exact AppUpgrade identity remains SHA-256
  `464a87646153213ce1f405743a10cff78eb90c203b619f983002358ca74ef0e7`,
  Build ID `863a8730e66a1c5245a1bf458fe2554adee0351a`. Four bare
  `decryptionFile` strings were classified: three logging/function labels and
  selected metadata payload `0x446479`. No normalized/declarative signature or
  old-style target encoding occurs.
- `AppUpgradeEngine::qt_metacall` first calls parent `AppEngineBase` dispatch,
  handles residual local IDs `0..84`, then subtracts 85; the parent handles 11
  local rows after QObject. Row 64 is therefore local, not an asserted absolute
  index. Its generated case copies the two QString arguments and forwards to
  `0x100b30`, but availability is not invocation evidence.
- The direct target inventory remains three calls in row-60
  `copyWhatsNewFiles()`—system tree `0x10281c`, top-level archive `0x102de9`,
  controls tree `0x103398`—plus generated forwarding `0x16e030`.
- All 90 old-style connects resolve to static signal/member strings; all 105
  imported named invokes resolve to distinct literal names and request
  AutoConnection. None selects row 64. The selected constructor has 29 string
  connects (28 Auto, one Direct) and two Auto functors, also non-target. Four
  string timers select another slot. No row-64 candidate exists for attributing
  queued/direct/blocking semantics or queued QString copying.
- The constructor calls session-bus helper `0xb8b40` with this exact object.
  The helper attaches six adaptors and calls `registerObject` with option
  `1 = ExportAdaptors`. Those adaptors have 30 local rows (16 slots, 14 signals),
  no target row, and 16 non-target literal forwarders. ExportAdaptors does not
  export ordinary parent slots. Twelve separate D-Bus signal subscriptions
  select other ordinary slots, not row 64.
- No audited route selects row 64. Runtime registration/policy,
  synthesized/indexed or cross-library/external producers, exact-ELF invocation,
  arguments, and attacker control remain unknown.
- Independent review and re-review returned `CHANGES_REQUIRED`. The first round
  covered the interpreter/validation record and lack of durable regeneration;
  re-review required machine consumption of registration fields, true
  `connectImpl` callback def-use, row-derived adaptor forwarders, and removal of
  an optional proximity-only claim. The remediation adds
  `tools/uk_fw/appfumo_decryption_dispatch_provenance.py`, strict manifest,
  compact deterministic privacy-safe JSON report, and
  `tests/test_appfumo_decryption_dispatch_provenance.py`. Constructor target and
  register dataflow now bind helper/option values; callback slot objects and
  function fields are tracked per call; and all 16 public adaptor rows are bound
  through static dispatch and implementation bodies to same-name invokes.
  Validation uses the project-approved `<platformio-env>/bin/python3` and the
  requested focused pytest command; the old focused test reports `19 passed,
  25 subtests passed`, and the final combined command reports `37 passed,
  31 subtests passed`. Corrected independent re-review returned **ACCEPT**. The
  full tests-scoped suite passed `736 tests, 351451 subtests`; the post-stage
  public harness passed `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`, scanning
  `388` files with zero privacy blockers and three informational identifiers.
- Added `evidence/appfumo-decryption-producer-provenance.md`, compact retained
  evidence, and a resumable package under
  `docs/agent-work/appfumo-decryption-producer-provenance/`. No target code or
  D-Bus request was executed; no payload, malformed input, package, staging,
  privilege, root, or persistence action was created.

## CVE-2018-9568 socket clone creator checkpoint — 2026-11-07

- Work began on requested baseline
  `78aa695145745370e839e3911338fcb9b6d0fe49`. A concurrent external workspace
  commit advanced HEAD to `1d6d30611be2721e78d1ccf53af836039fa2f9c3` and
  included the protected unrelated MICOM source plus `.gitignore`; this audit
  did not create that commit and did not reset, amend, stage, stash, remove, or
  push it. The protected source and untracked binary were not edited or executed
  by this audit after the advance. A second concurrent external commit,
  `517a63c985ce2365c33f73efddcd632921d6789b` (parent `1d6d306...`), later
  advanced HEAD while registering unrelated V-036; this audit likewise did not
  create, stage, amend, reset, or push it.
- The exact recovered EU `260128` kernel has the direct upstream patch shape
  for CVE-2018-9568. Complete `sk_clone_lock
  [0xffffffff814787f9,0xffffffff81478abd)` allocates through source current
  `sk_prot` at `+0x28`, performs one variable copy from `+0x78` for
  `obj_size-0x78`, then reloads source `+0x28` at `0xffffffff81478862` and
  stores it to child `sk_prot_creator +0x1a0` at `0xffffffff81478867`.
- Exact raw descriptor bytes at protocol `+0x100` bind `tcp_prot` object size
  to `0x780` (`80 07 00 00` at file `0xcc12e0`) and `tcpv6_prot` size to
  `0x840` (`40 08 00 00` at file `0xcc6dc0`). The second copy's instructions
  set both endpoints to `+0x78`, load dword `[source current proto+0x100]`, and
  subtract `0x78`, producing lengths `0x708`/`0x7c8`. Creator qword
  `[0x1a0,0x1a8)` is `[0x128,0x130)` relative to that start, so both spans copy
  every creator byte. The fixed first copy is only `0x60` bytes. The
  creator-overwriting copy ends at `0xffffffff8147884e`; normal
  control is linear through the reviewed LSM callback to the load/store at
  `0xffffffff81478862..0xffffffff81478867`. No later creator-overwriting copy
  or `+0x1a0` store occurs. The complete function's only post-copy direct
  `sk_free` is at `0xffffffff81478a12`; both of its failure decisions follow
  the store, and its block returns null through the sole epilogue. Every
  non-null return is therefore corrected. Separately, each TCP caller tests the
  returned child before later `tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock` cleanup, so caller-side
  cleanup occurs only after successful corrected return. Exact
  `security_fixup_ops` fills the intervening configured/default LSM hook with
  complete no-op `cap_sk_clone_security`.
- Complete allocator/free binding confirms `sk_alloc` initializes current and
  creator together, `sk_prot_alloc` selects protocol slab `+0xf8` and object
  size `+0x100`, and `__sk_free` at `0xffffffff814784ea` selects final cache
  through creator. The address-form option-1 branch can rewrite current
  protocol to exact `tcp_prot` without rewriting creator. The compiled child
  path is `tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock -> tcp_create_openreq_child ->
  inet_csk_clone_lock -> sk_clone_lock`.
- Exact identities remain vmlinux SHA-256 `f5ee9c...b102b`, Build ID
  `273378887b4cf563c10862fdf18b2292765df781`, map SHA-256
  `2cfba9...e3c1f`, and configuration SHA-256 `987268...dad56` with NET, INET,
  IPV6, and SLUB enabled and USER_NS disabled. All ten supplied raw function
  hashes independently match.

  `756c9749346bda510e242b02b849448418196bc1f95684dbcbbf362eff60d8ba`.
  Both corresponding 20261102 analysis copies pass byte-for-byte `cmp` and
  produce the same authoritative hashes; that directory is not canonical
  provenance. The patch bodies are not retained in tracked evidence because
  both include the full
  operational trigger program. Exact-static artifact SHA-256 is
  `e876c4eddfc08de17ded57371c447a93c44a44031265c34fb5ffa1decb253273`.
- Added a 15-input Boolean-only schema-v2 classifier that separates direct
  patch shape, equivalent fix, vulnerable semantics, positively established
  absent route, and indeterminate evidence. Incomplete/conflicting evidence
  fails closed. The full 32,768-state domain asserts every classification and
  output field; key/type/CLI tests reject every missing key, unknown keys,
  duplicate/abbreviated options, and non-Boolean input. Output is deterministic
  sorted UTF-8 through `sys.stdout.buffer` with exactly one LF independent of
  `PYTHONIOENCODING`; default report SHA-256 is
  `aa495e1103098e4926d1996a9bf31c4bdea8b0c3c8a6358f0cb71c6ea60cc1cd`.
- The named mismatch is rejected for this exact kernel. Machine-code shape does
  not establish direct cherry-pick provenance. Installed/running identity,
  runtime policy/route, wrong-cache free, corruption, privilege escalation,
  unrestricted root, persistence, broad socket/allocator safety, and every
  vendor-equivalent defect remain unobserved or unresolved.
- Validation status and final path hashes are recorded in
  `docs/agent-work/socket-clone-creator/CHECKPOINT.md`. No recovered target was
  executed; no socket, address-form operation, clone, listener, traffic,
  malformed input, trigger, exploit, privilege action, or persistence action
  was created or performed.

## Broadcom BSA SDP CVE-2017-0785 continuation checkpoint — 2026-11-05

- Integration base and analysis HEAD remained
  `a790800dba1e292a2aa27eae3e3a52c316643c9b`. Existing unrelated MICOM/IAS
  residue was neither inspected nor modified. Nothing was staged, committed, or
  pushed.
- Both exact FDE-bounded `process_service_search` functions have the public
  CVE-2017-0785 fix's decisive effect. In `vbtd-51 [0x841a40,0x841dbe)`, BP is
  the current recomputed successful-result count, R13W is the parsed
  continuation offset, `cmpw %bp,%r13w; ja` at `0x841b54..0x841b58` rejects
  exactly unsigned offset greater than count, and the independent CCB `+0xb6`
  expected-offset comparison follows at `0x841b5a..0x841b5e`. Both failures
  reach the code-5 call at `0x841bc0`; only dual-check fallthrough reaches
  subtraction `0x841b65` and later indexed read `0x841cc8`.
- `vbtd-63 [0x842230,0x8425a6)` has equivalent effects at
  `0x842344..0x84234e`, code-5 call `0x8423b0`, subtraction `0x842355`, and
  later indexed read `0x8424b0`. Equality is intentionally accepted by the
  unsigned-above check, yields zero remaining handles, and skips indexing.
  Both checks therefore dominate subtraction and later continuation handle
  indexing in both functions.
- Exact raw FDE hashes are `vbtd-51`
  `c91b38ace847bee71d0ab971c7f90d5d3fe5d5347296991b6961e91780cae5f4`
  (894 bytes) and `vbtd-63`
  `c35ecefa9aa2f28268df0c697c79e31c4fe000a1fc56c6ab9aff004dd1a36ef7`
  (886 bytes). ELF SHA-256 and Build IDs remain
  `55e21d...c9e0` / `12175aa88ccff70cc56498e0208c9a51aac0c9e9` and
  `c56b68...b26b9` / `04141ed222ee8f150c0eb0e46fdb73624d168920`.
- Added `evidence/broadcom-bsa-sdp-continuation-cve-2017-0785.md`, sanitized
  static artifact, byte-identical public patch, and
  `tools/uk_fw/bluetooth_sdp_continuation_model.py`. The model exhausts 24
  bounded Boolean/state cases, keeps current-result bound and expected-offset
  match independent, fails closed on key/type/state errors, and emits explicit
  deterministic UTF-8/LF JSON through `sys.stdout.buffer`.
- Final SHA-256 values: model

  deterministic default report
  `d7db08cc11dd1affbf5bfd086bdbac166c28854ff419b49cebe6717aefeb04ec`.
- Validation passed focused `11 tests, 56 subtests`, required full suite
  `637 tests, 318312 subtests`, `py_compile`, 45 exact-static/report assertions,
  retained-patch byte comparison, deterministic output/hash checks,
  `git diff --check`, and public harness
  `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. Independent narrow read-only
  package review returned **ACCEPT** with no blocking findings. Test subprocesses
  were host Python processes only; no recovered target was executed.
- The named continuation-offset unsigned-underflow/OOB information-disclosure
  mechanism is rejected for these exact functions. Direct fix-shaped behavior
  does not establish upstream cherry-pick provenance. General SDP safety,
  installed identity, service startup, runtime handler/channel reachability,
  adapter and security policy, malformed-input behavior, actual disclosure,
  code execution, unrestricted root, persistence, and owner-device
  applicability remain unknown. SDP code and configured `vbtd.service` do not
  resolve those runtime boundaries.
- Implementation and self-review ran in parent-assigned Daybreak child thread
  `06b3775a-bbc2-4080-8ffd-ecbda0b5d874`. Its attempted configured DeepSeek
  Flash worker dispatch was rejected as an unknown model, so no DeepSeek worker
  ran and no substitute provider/model was used. Parent root review and a
  separate read-only Daybreak worker review followed.
- No Bluetooth endpoint, radio, packet/PDU, malformed fixture, payload, or
  exploit material was used or created.

## Broadcom BSA SDP small-maximum checkpoint — 2026-11-05

- Exact analysis started at `0a9a7f2fd1cb3b25d928fe9f32fe65cac055d121`;
  final pre-delivery integration review used
  `30f6cace8d2c776b2501c88791b7e54dd4da9055`. Recovered binaries and ignored
  static inputs were unchanged. Concurrent commit `30f6cac` accidentally
  absorbed a preliminary SDP changelog entry while the actual model, tests,
  assessment, patch, and static artifact remained untracked. This delivery
  corrects that wording and records the complete package without rewriting
  shared history.
- CVE-2017-13255 (`process_service_attr_req`) and CVE-2017-13256
  (`process_service_search_attr_req`) are now assessed against both exact
  PCB-selectable images. The binding is `vbtd-51` SHA-256
  `55e21d077082e97f56fb113a1d3b216c0f2e63aa02fc4cd754a6593bc6cec9e0`,
  Build ID `12175aa88ccff70cc56498e0208c9a51aac0c9e9`, and `vbtd-63`
  SHA-256 `c56b68fdd35b16b95688ab54a48ffb9f18034d925c057e86f8b9fe304f8b26b9`,
  Build ID `04141ed222ee8f150c0eb0e46fdb73624d168920`.
- Both complete handler ranges lack the public fix's source-like
  `max_list_len < 4` branch. The `0..3` matrix is the effective internal maximum
  after the remote-MTU cap, and equals a small peer-requested maximum only under
  an ordinary protocol-valid remote MTU. It requires syntactically valid input,
  ordinary response-list construction, successful scratch allocation/reuse,
  and valid internal continuation state. On that feasible initial path, header
  construction can reach scratch offset 2, so effective maxima 0..2 exceed the
  logical effective limit; body construction is blocked for this domain.
  Earlier error exits are outside the matrix.
- Complete `sdpu_build_partial_attrib_entry` ranges `[0x8445f0,0x8448bf)` and
  `[0x844d90,0x84504f)` prove that valid-state copy length and destination
  advancement are clamped to `min(remaining, total serialized length - state-
  derived attr_offset)`. Corrupted/impossible offsets, general helper safety,
  and low/invalid remote-MTU subtraction behavior remain unknown.
- The public physical mechanism is conditionally rejected for these exact
  binaries by positive allocator/caller effects. Every scratch call uses remote
  MTU rather than the effective small maximum; exact `GKI_getbuf[_r]` selects a
  capacity-sufficient pool; allocation failure is checked; and exact pool 0
  user capacity is `0x40` in both initializers. The largest proven extent on
  the stated path is 3 bytes within at least 64 user bytes.
- Retained public fix commit
  `f0edf6571d2d58e66ee0b100ebe49c585d31489f` byte-for-byte at patch SHA-256
  `a0470c20592473144f8114cf41ab4cb2479fe2c108a4aa73fa4864eabd02ca34`.
  Added `evidence/broadcom-bsa-sdp-small-max-cves.md`, the exact-static artifact,
  and `tools/uk_fw/bluetooth_sdp_small_max_model.py` with exhaustive tests.
  Final SHA-256 values: model

  `7d471272700166a4ea26ece68fc4ffdcdeec47d38ec799a379a66523c4258590`.
- Correction-cycle validation: focused `9 passed, 52 subtests passed`; required
  suite `626 passed, 318256 subtests passed`; `py_compile`, complete LLVM
  regeneration including both helpers, helper clamp/copy/advance and unwind
  checks, binary/hash/address checks, byte-identical patch comparison, and
  `git diff --check` passed. Public harness passed
  `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`.
  No target, Bluetooth/radio/endpoint, packet/PDU, malformed fixture, controlled
  execution, or exploit material was used. The conclusion is limited to the
  public small-maximum physical OOB-write mechanism under the stated
  prerequisites. Runtime reachability, adapter/channel/security policy,
  low/invalid negotiated-MTU and allocator edge cases, corrupted internal
  offsets, other SDP or vendor-equivalent behavior, impacts, and owner-device
  applicability remain unknown. Independent final package review returned
  **ACCEPT** after the moving-base, stale-checkpoint, and changelog-order
  corrections; acceptance is limited to the exact-static package and bounded
  conclusion, not runtime SDP safety or impact.

## DCCPv6 path applicability correction checkpoint — 2026-11-05

- CVE-2017-6074 is rejected for the exact recovered stock package only for the
  specific public request path requiring DCCP core (`input.o`) plus DCCPv6/IPv6
  (`ipv6.o`). Under applicable public v4.1 Kconfig/Kbuild rules, exact
  `IP_DCCP=n` excludes the whole named DCCP subtree. A fresh read-only inventory
  of the canonical decrypted stock archive, SHA-256
  `423491fd8b86bd815d4e12f47054e08a589a5159f87213f08980fcc3a0e47c84`,
  finds 163 regular `.ko` members and no canonical DCCP core or DCCPv6 module.
- The complete ten-name authoritative-map inventory is split into queried core
  and DCCPv6 identities and returns zero rows. Exact queried presence would
  establish the corresponding translation unit. IPv4-only functional evidence
  establishes core presence but not the CVE path; positive complete DCCPv6
  functional evidence overrides absence.
- The corrected 15-input schema-v2 model decouples physical component/path
  classification from the public CVE dependency. Rejection is exactly
  dependency plus physical path absence. Incomplete states remain unknown;
  positive component evidence takes precedence and reports conflicts.
  `CONFIG_INET=y` and `CONFIG_IPV6=y` remain bounded contrary facts, an
  `IPv6=n` input alone does not prove general IPv6 absence, and USER_NS is
  non-decisive.
- Retained byte-identical mainline fix
  `5edabca9d4cff7f1f2b68f0bac55ef99d9798ba4` and stable 4.1.y backport
  `98442999b9671784e659b205be8b5b6be8e81629`. The retained official
  `ChangeLog-4.1.41` release commit/date records 15 June 2017; the unretained
  archive-index claim was removed. History is contextual; no recovered-code fix
  provenance/effect is claimed.
- Focused validation passes `13 tests, 32793 subtests`; the complete suite
  passes `617 tests, 318204 subtests`; bytecode compilation, exact static checks,
  and `git diff --check` pass. The public harness passes with
  `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. Corrected independent review
  returned **ACCEPT** with no blocking findings. Generic public research used
  Astra; implementation provenance is `codex-router/gpt-daybreak-blue-latest`.
  DeepSeek remained static-ready/runtime-unverified and did not run. No target
  or named-target interaction was used.

## Pipe iterator CVE-2015-1805 applicability checkpoint — 2026-11-05

- CVE-2015-1805 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by complete machine
  code, not by the `4.1.27-abl` banner. Both `pipe_write` copy sites directly
  call exact `copy_page_from_iter`; `pipe_read` directly calls exact
  `copy_page_to_iter`.
- Both complete successor-bounded helpers clamp requested bytes against iterator
  count, traverse fixed 16-byte descriptors, account only
  requested-minus-residual progress, carry advanced page/user positions and
  remaining budget into fallback, and commit iterator offset/count/descriptor/
  segment state. Neither helper stores to descriptor `iov_base`/`iov_len`.
- Public history binds the legacy introduction
  `f6762b7ad8edd6abc802542ce845d3bc8adcb92f`, read conversion
  `637b58c2887e5e57850865839cc75f59184b23d1`, and write conversion
  `f0d1bec9d58d4c038d0ac958c9af82be6eb18045`. Ordinary upstream 4.1 already
  contains both conversions; legacy stable adaptations and CVE-2016-0774 are
  contextual alternatives, not required 4.1 fixes. Version history alone is
  not a vendor verdict.
- Exact-name absence of the old pipe-local helpers is corroboration only.
  Ordinary local pipe functionality remains compiled. This is not general
  pipe/iov-iterator safety, every vendor-equivalent defect absence, installed
  identity, or runtime policy evidence. Public source-level impact was
  unprivileged local memory corruption/privilege escalation; triggering,
  corruption, root and persistence remain unobserved.
- Added three retained public patches, complete exact static evidence, a
  dedicated assessment, and a 17-input schema-v2 Boolean-only model with
  fail-closed all-or-none CLI, tri-state incomplete-effect handling, explicit
  broken-legacy-path precedence, optional progress-preserving legacy
  alternative, ordinary-local-functionality scope, null runtime/impact
  outcomes, and exhaustive field assertions. Focused validation passed `10
  tests, 131109 subtests`; the complete suite passed `604 tests, 285411
  subtests`; bytecode compilation, exact patch/disassembly/hash checks, and
  scoped `git diff --check` passed. After public maintainer email addresses were
  redacted from a previously committed XFRM changelog excerpt, the public
  harness passed with `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. Independent
  read-only review accepted the technical verdict with no blocking findings;
  its moving-base bookkeeping note was integrated. Exact hashes are in the
  checkpoint. No recovered target or prohibited pipe, vector-copy, fault, race,
  grooming, or exploit operation was used.

## XFRM-user path applicability checkpoint — 2026-11-04

- CVE-2017-7184 is rejected for the recovered stock package only for the
  upstream/named `CONFIG_XFRM_USER` `XFRM_MSG_NEWAE -> xfrm_new_ae` update
  path. Exact configuration disables `XFRM_USER`. A fresh read-only inventory
  directly against the canonical decrypted stock archive, SHA-256
  `423491fd8b86bd815d4e12f47054e08a589a5159f87213f08980fcc3a0e47c84`,
  finds 163 regular `.ko` members and no `xfrm_user.ko`; the translation
  unit/interface is not built or shipped. The mutable extracted staging tree is
  not used as proof of stock identity.
- The authoritative map has no exact row for any of the complete eight-name
  query inventory: `xfrm_new_ae`, `xfrm_replay_verify_len`,
  `xfrm_user_rcv_msg`, `xfrm_netlink_rcv`, `xfrm_user_net_init`,
  `xfrm_user_init`, `xfrm_dispatch`, or `xfrm_msg_min`. This bounded inventory
  does not globally exclude every inline, renamed, or vendor-equivalent route.
- Contrary scope is retained: `CONFIG_XFRM=y`; complete
  `xfrm_init_replay [0xffffffff8151979d,0xffffffff815197f6)` and exact
  state/policy/replay symbols remain; three IPv6 XFRM mode modules are shipped.
  `CONFIG_NET_KEY` is separately disabled and is not conflated with this path.
- Public history records introducing commit
  `d8647b79c3b7e223ac051439d165bc8e7bbb832f`, historical incomplete verifier
  `e2b19125e94124daaeda1ddcf9b85b04575ad86f`, and official stable 4.1.y
  backports `438db92d7f2792e3bad17be70e6edf0f44a081f0` and
  `171a957989c4f398adb41078dbfff73b0821e383`, both first in Linux 4.1.49
  (22 January 2018). This is contextual only; exact absent-path evidence
  controls. Verifier presence alone is not remediation, and both fix effects or
  exact equivalents would be required if the path existed.
- Added retained introducing/incomplete-verifier history, both authoritative
  mainline fixes, both stable 4.1.y backports, the Linux 4.1.49 release and
  changelog records, exact static artifact, dedicated assessment, and a
  ten-input schema-v2 Boolean model. Focused validation passed `8 tests, 1056
  subtests`; the complete suite passed `594 tests, 154302 subtests`; and the
  public harness passed `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. An initial
  independent review accepted the technical verdict but rejected stale
  validation wording, a moving integration base, and missing retained history;
  those package defects were corrected on frozen base `7074707`; corrected
  independent review returned **ACCEPT** with no blocking or nonblocking
  findings. Exact hashes are in the checkpoint. No recovered target or
  prohibited target/runtime operation was used.

## BPF syscall-path applicability checkpoint — 2026-11-04

- CVE-2017-16995 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` only for the named
  syscall-based eBPF verifier path. `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL` is disabled, weak
  `sys_bpf` aliases complete `sys_ni_syscall` and returns `-ENOSYS`, and native
  x86-64 syscall-table slot 321 points to the same stub.
- `CONFIG_BPF=y`; classic BPF validation, creation, attachment, interpreter, and
  runtime symbols remain compiled. The verdict does not establish broad BPF or
  classic-BPF safety, all alternate eBPF-entry absence, verifier-internal
  correctness, installed-device identity, or runtime behavior.
- Upstream commit `95a762e2c8c942780948091f8f2a4f32fce1ac6f` says unprivileged
  exploitability starts with v4.14. The exact artifact is vendor 4.1-derived,
  but the rejection rests on exact configuration and dispatch evidence rather
  than banner/version inference.
- Added the authoritative patch, exact static artifact, dedicated assessment,
  and a nine-input schema-v2 Boolean model. Focused validation passed `8 tests,
  529 subtests`; the complete suite passed `586 tests, 153246 subtests`; the
  public harness and bytecode compilation passed; independent exact-binary and
  package review returned **ACCEPT**. No recovered target, target operation,
  code load, communication endpoint, verifier input, verifier trigger, race,
  payload, crash, privilege action, or persistence mechanism was used or created.

## TTY line-discipline reference checkpoint — 2026-11-04

- CVE-2016-0723 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by retained-reference
  effects matching upstream `5c17c861a357e9458001f021a7afa7aab9937439`;
  stripped machine code cannot establish direct commit provenance.
- Exact `tty_ioctl [0xffffffff812871f8,0xffffffff81287d46)` dispatches command
  `0x5424` to `0xffffffff812879f9`, calls exact `tty_ldisc_ref_wait`, loads the
  retained `ldisc->ops->num` afterward, calls exact `__put_user_4`, and calls
  exact `tty_ldisc_deref` before return. The copy result is not branched on
  before dereference, so user-copy error is covered.
- Complete exact `tty_ldisc_ref_wait`, `tty_ldisc_ref`, and `tty_ldisc_deref`
  ranges bind their `ldsem_down_read`, `ldsem_down_read_trylock`, and
  `ldsem_up_read` calls. The verdict is limited to the named unlocked
  dereference; general TTY safety, installed identity, and all runtime/impact
  observations remain unproved.
- Added the authoritative patch, complete retained assembly, and a twelve-input
  schema-v2 Boolean model. Focused validation passed `8 tests, 4111 subtests`;
  the complete suite passed `578 tests, 152717 subtests`; the public harness and
  bytecode compilation passed; independent exact-binary/package review returned
  **ACCEPT**. No recovered target, target operation, terminal, thread, race, or
  trigger material was used or created.

## compat netfilter path checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- CVE-2016-4997 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by an absent compiled prerequisite: IA32 emulation is disabled, `CONFIG_COMPAT=y` is absent, weak `compat_sys_setsockopt` aliases exact `sys_ni_syscall` and returns `-ENOSYS`, and no compat iptables translation/check symbol occurs in the authoritative map.
- Native `do_ipt_set_ctl` and `do_ip6t_set_ctl` remain compiled, so the conclusion is limited to the CVE-specific 32-bit compat implementations and is not a general netfilter safety claim. `CONFIG_USER_NS=n` separately removes the public in-container-root setup.
- Added exact stub evidence, authoritative upstream fixes, and a five-input schema-v2 model. Focused validation passed `6 tests, 36 subtests`; the complete suite passed `570 tests, 148606 subtests`; the public harness passed; corrected independent exact-binary/package review returned **ACCEPT**. No target syscall, socket, namespace, packet, filter table, target execution, crash, or privilege action was created.

## key read/revoke race checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- CVE-2015-7550 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by same-rwsem effects matching upstream `b4a1b4f5047e4f54e194681125c74c0aa64d637d`; stripped code cannot establish commit provenance.
- Exact `keyctl_read_key [0xffffffff811b509a,0xffffffff811b516e)` takes `key +0x20` for reading before `key_validate`, retains the lock through the optional read callback, and unlocks afterward. Exact `key_revoke [0xffffffff811b239c,0xffffffff811b2401)` takes that same rwsem for writing across revoked-state bit 2 and the optional revoke callback.
- The six-input schema-v2 model leaves incomplete fix facts unknown absent an explicit unlocked-window fact. No target/keyctl syscall, key, thread, race, allocation pressure, target execution, crash, or privilege action was created. Focused validation passed `8 tests, 73 subtests`; the complete suite passed `564 tests, 148570 subtests`; the public harness passed; independent exact-binary/package review returned **ACCEPT**.

## Update-source runtime-policy checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- Both recovered eMMC fstab branches configure `/dev/mmcblk0p9` at `/update` as ext4 with `defaults,noatime,journal_checksum`, establishing writable-filesystem configuration rather than live mount success.
- `smack_setup.sh` conditionally creates `/update/usb/bin` and placeholder AppUpgrade/AppScomoUpgrade files, then sets only their `SMACK64EXEC=App::upgrade` transition label. It does not pin uid/gid/mode or set the `SMACK64` access label.
- The recovered policy permits the floor label and 22 named `App::*` labels to write an object labelled `App::upgrade`, but staged object/directory labels, DAC metadata, process uid/gid/labels, loaded rules and update serialization remain runtime gates. Actor write access and V-031 substitution remain unproved.
- Extended `tools/uk_fw/bench_state_bundle.py` to capture `/update` namespace metadata, complete process uid/gid sets plus supplementary groups, and read-only `SMACK64`/`SMACK64EXEC` results for source/trust paths. Absent paths, absent attributes, unavailable provider, query errors, malformed labels and successes remain distinct. Focused validation passed `23 tests, 20 subtests`; the full suite passed `556 tests, 148497 subtests`; the public harness passed; corrected independent review returned **ACCEPT**. See `evidence/update-source-runtime-policy.md`.

## AppFUMO ISO9660 mount-prerequisite post-delivery follow-up — 2026-11-08

- This is a bounded follow-up to the accepted V-033 pathname package below, not
  a rewrite of its prior acceptance. The worker opened at `ec93aed`; initial
  review used `fe3d363`; non-overlapping integration commits advanced through
  `a1f1351` to final-check HEAD
  `750cfcfbd88937576fde9ee61e83fd6c1980f28d`. The ISO9660 raw-date UUID byte
  route remains established through libblkid/udev into the automounter's path
  component.
- Exact userspace also has the missing intermediate behavior: ordinary USB
  mass-storage `sd*` events can reach builtin blkid; the generic non-NTFS/exFAT
  branch copies filesystem type `iso9660` into direct `mount(2)`; initial
  failure reaches explicit read-only flags `0xc0ed000b`; and `UsbMount` is sent
  only after either mount succeeds (`0x4d70`, `0x4df1`, `0x4e34`).
- Canonical archive SHA-256
  `423491fd8b86bd815d4e12f47054e08a589a5159f87213f08980fcc3a0e47c84`
  contains bzImage SHA-256 `2fec21219b4e52c90d287687f3cfd4fbdc55ad00f71117b02c32134487277582`.
  Boot-header-derived bounded legacy-LZ4 decode yields vmlinux SHA-256
  `f5ee9c2f97eed44f9827153c273125bf131a9ca9a96c63bb6e93cfc5af6b102b`,
  Build ID `273378887b4cf563c10862fdf18b2292765df781`; its unique gzip IKCONFIG is
  byte-identical to config SHA-256
  `987268a1a4b333d67c219c63b690c3828811136a7a3b203eb6f20552e82dad56`.
  That config has `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR`, `CONFIG_ISO9660_FS`, and `CONFIG_UDF_FS`
  unset at byte offsets `0x861a`, `0x17e34`, and `0x17e53`.
- The 163-member inventory has no exact tested isofs/ISO9660, UDF, `sr_mod`, or
  `sr` module basename/path; 11 hash-bound metadata payloads have none of the
  bounded filesystem identifiers or SCSI type-5/block-major-11 aliases. This
  does not prove every renamed, inline, or vendor-equivalent implementation
  absent; the embedded config `n` rows decide the named built-in paths.
- These bindings reject only the named canonical ISO9660/UDF and SCSI CD-ROM
  routes. Broad exact recovered-stack ISO9660 and physical-optical routes remain
  unknown because inline, renamed, and vendor-equivalent implementations were
  not exhaustively excluded. The pre-mount UUID route remains established.
- AppDMClient root-entry processing remains conditional on a successful port-1
  callback. Installed-unit identity/extra modules, physical source control,
  accepted mount on a materially different runtime, exact mixed-case/dot ISO
  naming extensions, and the AppDMClient-to-inner-AppUpgrade bridge remain
  unknown.
- Schema v5 emits named prerequisite absence `true`, named canonical ISO9660
  and physical-optical routes `false`, and broad exact-stack route outputs
  `null`. The pre-recorded installed mount remains `null`; explicit true still
  requires a materially different runtime identity. Identity-chain outputs
  remain positive. Deterministic default report SHA-256 is
  `56b7a941a4180472292af59e60b5b1bdf5b3e369205b75519a3d3c4f073f1804`.
- LZ4 literal/match lengths and aggregate output are checked against remaining
  capacity before extension; overlap copy is chunk-bounded without repeated-
  pattern multiplication. Compact retained artifact SHA-256 is
  `7935f331841eed2374a8318ce5f4d9c287cc76225ebefbfd9dd4e5a94b62cc0e`.
  Assessment, validation, residual gates, and final package hashes are in
  `evidence/appfumo-iso9660-mount-prerequisite.md` and
  `docs/agent-work/appfumo-iso9660-mount-prerequisite/CHECKPOINT.md`.
- Independent review required two correction cycles (identity/alias binding,
  then bounded LZ4 allocation and broad-claim scope); the corrected package
  returned **ACCEPT**. Focused validation passed `24 tests`; the full
  tests-scoped suite passed `718 tests, 351445 subtests`; and the post-stage
  public harness passed `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`, scanning
  `383` files with zero privacy blockers and three informational identifiers.
- Static/read-only target analysis only. No target execution, mount,
  media/image/archive, malformed input, path/command/payload, D-Bus request,
  target syscall, privilege/root action, or persistence action occurred. The
  implementation worker did not delegate or alter repository state; the parent
  used a separate read-only reviewer. Unrelated
  `tools/uk_fw/ias_backend_soft/micom_service.c` was not touched or staged.

## AppFUMO USB pathname-provenance checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- First independent review returned **CHANGES_REQUIRED** with a P0 dispatcher
  reversal. The corrected package follows dispatcher `0x3a50..0x3b49` instead
  of carrying event-caller `r8/r9` directly into mount entry `0x4c00`.
  `0x3a59` preserves UUID/alternate, `0x3a5e` label, `0x3a8d` model; the mount
  branch remaps FS type to `rdx`, label to `rcx`, UUID/alternate to `r8`, model
  to `r9`, then tail-jumps at `0x3b49`.
- At mount entry, FS type becomes `rbx`, label `r15`, UUID/alternate `r13`, and
  model stack `+8`. `0x4d16` pushes UUID/alternate as final `%s`, proving stock
  `/media/usb/<port>/<UUID-or-alternate>`. Label and model are separate D-Bus
  fields. This matches `evidence/vm-bringup/usb-root-vector-map.md`.
- Canonical archive SHA-256 remains
  `423491fd8b86bd815d4e12f47054e08a589a5159f87213f08980fcc3a0e47c84`.
  Direct extraction binds `./lib/libblkid.so.1.1.0` SHA-256
  `56a6b8b7fd08dcec92a6c1ad84bc7a7cc44071f33c571339415e1cbf00d60701`,
  Build ID `c6f98d98cb2cbc2ff864167f37048233d90a8fef`. It matches the reviewed
  extracted copy. `usb-automount` remains SHA-256
  `7db44d8e34fbece4d5b8ef4896a99239cb540a22d1d756335dde4bc219af3802`,
  Build ID `20748cf9928ba155ac4201a33bb1e29e64ae9139`.
- Second independent review returned **CHANGES_REQUIRED** with a P0 ISO9660
  exception to the blanket UUID-family negative. Constrained VFAT/exFAT/NTFS/
  ext/UDF forms remain negative, but exact libblkid `[0x1c4c0,0x1c654)` copies
  16 raw modified/created-date bytes, checks only whether all equal ASCII `'0'`,
  and formats raw `%c` values with format `0x35368`. Matching util-linux v2.27.1
  `iso9660.c` lines 110-151 has SHA-256
  `601d9311b1a68b5fbccf7d6af28f089b4f919494b36edb7f144786cec651477b`.
  UUID `blkid_safe_string` preserves allowed `$`/`?`/`/` byte classes, and the
  dispatcher places them in the mount component. The ISO9660 static
  parser/transform/path byte route is established; the combined filesystem-
  metadata rejection is withdrawn.
- Label preservation remains confined to a separate D-Bus field. The no-UUID
  alternate still has no useful shell-active effect after serial sanitization
  in the prefixed word. Physical ISO9660 source control, media acceptance and
  successful mount remain unknown; no media/input example or arbitrary command
  execution claim was created.
- Exact per-binary edges remain separate: automounter D-Bus path output;
  AppDMClient callback pathname to `this+0x128` and staging; AppUpgrade package
  base plus `.whatsnew.tar.gz` at `0x102de9`, verifier, and unquoted sink. The
  AppDMClient launch-argument/inner-AppUpgrade constructor bridge, installed
  delivery, authentication, success, process context, privilege, root, and
  persistence remain unknown.
- Direct-call mapping remains corrected: `0x102de9` top-level package archive,
  `0x10281c` enumerated system-tree, `0x103398` enumerated controls-tree.
  Extraction QProcess operands exclude member names; member-name signature
  binding remains unknown.
- Third independent review returned **CHANGES_REQUIRED** only on sink-delivery
  causality. The runtime gate now means invocation of the relevant
  `decryptionFile` call with the delivered path, not generic AppUpgrade process
  startup. Physical source + mount + cross-process bridge + relevant invocation
  establishes only pre-auth decryption-input delivery. Overall physical
  shell-sensitive sink delivery additionally requires authentication acceptance
  because the verifier dominates command construction and `popen`.
- Schema-v4 strict Boolean/tri-state model separates constrained-family
  negatives, ISO9660 static byte route `true`, pre-auth physical
  decryption-input delivery `null`, and actual authenticated shell-sink delivery
  `null`. Command success still requires installed delivery, relevant
  `decryptionFile` invocation, and authentication; command success and
  amplification remain route-generic observations. Persistence stays
  independent. Tests pin all model outputs, exhaustive formulas, the explicit
  pre-auth-without-authentication case, ISO9660 exact binary rows/format bytes,
  source hash, dispatcher rows, archive identities, and encoding-independent
  output. Focused validation passed `18 tests`; retained artifact SHA-256 is
  `932510a860b40cce280f217670cbf2c213e31b0a90008ac5c011c933cd584e8f`, and
  frozen schema-v4 report SHA-256 is
  `026b421772bd708c7f6ccec9200ed8fb47fee3307b1821415c3b9db516854aa3`.
  Full details are recorded in the checkpoint.
- Repository provenance: planning baseline `394e76a`, worker-open base `9955460`,
  earlier concurrent heads `1c43670`, `72fd667`, and `4bb85f5`; current
  concurrent `HEAD` is `e74d96c`. Prior failed worker attempts and corrected
  staging deviation remain recorded. This P0 cycle used no delegation, staging,
  commit, push, reset, or history rewrite; coordinator `PLAN.md` remains
  immutable.
- Fourth independent review returned **ACCEPT** for the corrected frozen package.
  Focused validation passed `18 tests`; the required tests-scoped full suite
  passed `712 tests, 351445 subtests`; `py_compile`, deterministic encoding,
  exact-byte/hash, UTF-8/LF, and diff checks passed; the public harness passed
  `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. Static/read-only analysis only: no
  recovered target/helper execution, payload, media/input example, update,
  trigger, D-Bus request, mount, target syscall, privilege action, root action,
  or persistence action occurred.

## AppFUMO exact shell-boundary checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Exact embedded ELF identity remains SHA-256
  `464a87646153213ce1f405743a10cff78eb90c203b619f983002358ca74ef0e7`,
  size `5,066,264`, Build ID `863a8730e66a1c5245a1bf458fe2554adee0351a`.
  Homebrew LLVM `.eh_frame` binds `decryptionFile` to
  `[0x100b30,0x10110c)` and its direct command-helper target to separate FDE
  `[0x1397c0,0x1398fb)`.
- The exact split QString chain uses fixed helper, UUID-derived `/tmp` key
  pathname, incoming `encFile`, and incoming `destPath`. The pathname arguments
  occupy command fields without an observed quote/escape/filter step.
  `0x100e0c` calls the shared helper, which appends fixed stderr redirection,
  converts to bytes, and calls `popen` at `0x139867` with read mode. Under the
  libc interface this supplies shell interpretation.
- The helper drains output through a `0x200`-byte `fgets` buffer, does not
  accumulate it, calls `pclose` at `0x1398b0`, and ignores its status. The
  neighboring output-accumulating helper begins at `0x139900` and has its own
  FDE; it is not an alternate entry. After the call, `decryptionFile` removes
  the transient key, calls `sync`, and returns `destPath` without helper-status,
  destination-existence, or size checks. Its only ordinary fixed-failure returns
  precede the sink.
- Corrected literal provenance: full templates at `0x20b500` and `0x20b530`
  are selected by object byte `+0x22` in separate FDE `[0x60ac0,0x6178f)`, which
  calls the same shared helper and later checks destination existence/size. They
  are not the split templates referenced by `decryptionFile`. Prior direct
  producer calls `0x10281c`, `0x102de9`, `0x103398` remain in
  `copyWhatsNewFiles()`; generated row-64 call `0x16e030` remains separate.
- Added bounded exact evidence, `evidence/appfumo-shell-command-boundary.md`, a
  strict Boolean-only tri-state model, and focused tests. Pre-recorded output
  establishes exact unquoted shell-sink structure while leaving pathname
  influence, shell-character survival, invocation, authentication acceptance,
  process security context, command success, privilege/domain amplification,
  root, and persistence independently `null`. Static artifact SHA-256 is
  `a6bbe8e74630e7a64001a8bad2b5f67846f465473612a14e8bccf3aad47c5510`;
  deterministic default report SHA-256 is
  `7702f40e87033dfb9bbb271b3615c0ec5212d17c16c3965b151306e62b38bfc3`.
- Validation and delivery provenance are retained in
  `docs/agent-work/appfumo-shell-boundary/CHECKPOINT.md`. The reviewed 11-path
  package was absorbed into pushed concurrent commit `3f6bd7e`; its three
  unrelated IONIQ documentation paths remain attributed to the concurrent VM
  investigation. No target, recovered executable/helper, archive/update,
  operational shell payload/trigger, signature bypass, privilege action, root
  action, or persistence mechanism was executed or created.

## AppFUMO decryption producer/runtime provenance checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- Exact local `AppUpgradeEngine` row 60 is public slot `void copyWhatsNewFiles()`; generated row-60 case `0x16e59f` calls entry `0x101110`. Homebrew LLVM `.eh_frame` places selected direct calls `0x10281c`, `0x102de9`, and `0x103398` in the same FDE `[0x101110,0x104c1b)`, so all three belong to that implementation.
- The nonzero `0x6d20b4` branch supplies three resolved families: top-level `<branch-selected package base>/.whatsnew.tar.gz` to fixed `/update/whatsnew/temp/.whatsnew.tar.gz`; enumerated system-tree absolute paths to paired normal/USB-in-OTA system destinations; and enumerated controls-tree paths to paired normal/USB-in-OTA controls destinations. Generated row-64 call `0x16e030` remains separate.
- Expected public-log SHA-256 `84d5bb69270dd610b132c8950c31dd98adad844c5a2c108b4df617381685de86` contains **seven**, not six, exact-shape records: `1414,1710,7279,11714,11975,17205,21713`. All seven have matched `copyWhatsNewFiles` temporal context and normalized removable-USB archive -> update-temp archive classes. The additional line 21713 is preserved rather than ignored.
- Added fail-closed read-only parser/model, normalized retained JSON, bounded exact LLVM/FDE evidence, row-60 report, tests, and `evidence/appfumo-decryption-runtime-provenance.md`.
- Do not equate the logged installed build with the exact ELF: the log has no binary identity and does not distinguish direct, Qt meta-call, or other dispatch. Complete dynamic/indirect/external producers, external/D-Bus reachability, attacker control, acceptance, root, and persistence remain unknown.

## AppFUMO Qt 5 meta-object provenance checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- Exact Qt 5 revision-7 metadata resolves local `AppUpgradeEngine` row index 64 as public slot `QString decryptionFile(QString encFile, QString destPath)`. The method is declared in the selected meta-object. The later 2026-11-08 follow-up resolves parent `AppEngineBase` and the 11/85 local-count subtractions, but 64 is still not an asserted absolute method index because the QObject-derived runtime offset is unavailable; it is not signal number 64, and the meta-object has seven signals.
- Relocation-bound static metacall `0x16df80`, jump-table entry 64 (`0xffd299c6 -> 0x16dfc6`), and exact instructions resolve forwarding: `a[1] -> encFile -> %rdx`, `a[2] -> destPath -> %rcx`, call `0x100b30`, QString return -> `a[0]`. The target verifier call is `0x100bb0`.
- Added a bounded defensive decoder, synthetic/optional exact tests, strict evidence manifest plus current-excerpt hash verification, deterministic exact report, and `evidence/appfumo-qt-metaobject-provenance.md`. Exact report SHA-256 is `330799c5215a0d3fda7c8870820240cb023c9b3a6c9673100778a038fe1d14a3`; focused validation passed `29 tests, 8228 subtests`, the full tests-scoped suite passed `664 tests, 351250 subtests`, and the public/privacy harnesses passed.
- Complete producer provenance remains unresolved. The later 2026-11-08 follow-up rejects row-64 selection through the audited literal connects/invokes/timers and selected-object adaptors/subscriptions, while synthesized/indexed, indirect/cross-library/external paths, registration success/policy, exact-ELF runtime invocation, attacker control, update acceptance, root, and persistence remain unknown. A separate hash-bound public log observes runtime activity on an unidentified build; V-032's Boolean model remains unchanged and fail-closed.

## Inner FUMO authentication-coverage checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- V-032 binds exact embedded FUMO SHA-256 `464a87646153213ce1f405743a10cff78eb90c203b619f983002358ca74ef0e7`, Build ID `863a8730e66a1c5245a1bf458fe2554adee0351a`, startup argument flow, verifier `[0x45820,0x45d75)`, file-MD5 helper `[0x140f50,0x1413e4)`, and worker relaunch `[0x6c9a0,0x6cab5)`.
- Whole-`.text` scans find exactly six direct verifier calls (`0x7be3a,0x80095,0x802f0,0x9d1d2,0x100bb0,0x140092`) and two direct file-MD5 calls (`0x1432f6,0x15170c`). Fixed/enumerated operands cover the descriptor, archive, firmware entries, resources, or navigation files. Parameterized verifier operands are not fully classified: `0x100bb0` receives its target through `%rdx`, and direct caller `0x16e030` forwards a QString from a meta-call argument structure.
- Startup reduces `argv[0]` to a resource base directory, and the worker `execv` wrapper has no direct pre-exec verifier/hash step inside that FDE. The direct call-instruction inventory is complete, but outer-executable reauthentication remains unknown because parameterized target producers, indirect/virtual calls, external helpers/services, and loader/boot checks are unresolved. Final payload binding, runtime mutability, changed-object observation, successful launch, update acceptance, partition writes, slot/boot acceptance, root and persistence also remain unresolved.
- Added exact retained assembly, `evidence/appfumo-authentication-coverage.md`, and a thirteen-input schema-v2 model. Focused validation passed `10 tests, 8203 subtests`; the full suite passed `553 tests, 148482 subtests`; the public harness passed; corrected independent review returned **ACCEPT**. No updater, verifier, helper, target path, launch request, package, partition, slot, boot state, or target syscall was exercised.

## AppDMClient source-identity checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- V-031 records an exact caller-side pathname-reopen boundary in recovered AppDMClient. Verifier wrapper `[0x34870,0x34d43)` returns integer status only; staging verifies AppUpgrade/XML at `0x802db`/`0x80320` and later executes a pathname copy at `0x8296b`; the XML reader verifies at `0xe1ff7` and separately opens at `0xe22d5` or `0xe281f`.
- No retained open description, inode/device comparison, or identity revalidation binds those later consumers to the object examined by the earlier verifier. This proves static TOCTOU structure, not runtime substitution.
- Runtime source mutability/immutability, an actual object mismatch, successful staging/launch, effective indirect/external authentication, update acceptance, partition writes, slot switching, boot acceptance, root and persistence remain unobserved.
- Added retained exact assembly, `evidence/appdmclient-source-identity-boundary.md`, and an eleven-input schema-v2 Boolean model. The pre-recorded state reports the static boundary and conditional launch structure while runtime feasibility remains `null`. Focused validation passed `9 tests, 2056 subtests`; the full suite passed `543 tests, 140279 subtests`; the public harness passed. Independent corrected package review returned **ACCEPT**. No updater, source path, race, launch request, target execution, package, partition, or slot was exercised.

## exec argument-stack cap checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- CVE-2018-14634's oversized argument-space prerequisite is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by preventive cap effects matching upstream `da029c11e6b12f321f36dac8771e833b65cec962`; the stripped binary does not establish commit provenance.
- Complete exact `copy_strings [0xffffffff811161be,0xffffffff811164b0)` retains the historical `ARG_MAX` allowance and accepts larger space only when it is no greater than `min(rlimit(RLIMIT_STACK)/4, 0x600000)`. Oversize space passes the acquired page to exact `put_page` and returns through `-E2BIG`.
- `CONFIG_MMU=y` and `CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF=y` establish static support, not privileged-executable presence, runtime uid/SMACK/seccomp policy, large-vector construction, execution, stack corruption, or installed identity.
- The eleven-input schema-v2 model leaves incomplete construction/cap facts unknown absent an explicit unbounded path. No recovered-kernel exec syscall, target process, oversized target argument/environment vector, privileged target executable execution, target execution, crash, or privilege action was created; ordinary host validation used Python subprocesses outside those target claims. Focused validation passed `8 tests, 2062 subtests`; the full suite passed `534 tests, 138223 subtests`, and the public harness passed with `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. Independent exact-binary review returned **REJECTED-BY-FIX-EFFECTS** and final corrected package review returned **ACCEPT**.

## associative-array leaf-guard checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- CVE-2016-7914 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by leaf-guard effects matching upstream `8d4a2ec1e0b41b0cf9a0c5cd4511da7f8e4f3de2`; the stripped binary cannot establish commit provenance.
- Exact `assoc_array_insert [0xffffffff8121379b,0xffffffff812140ee)` loads each terminal-node slot, handles null, tests tag bit zero, and branches metadata-tagged node/shortcut pointers past the `ops->compare_object` callback at `0xffffffff812138b7`. Only a non-null leaf-tag fallthrough reaches the callback, and the loop covers all 16 slots.
- `CONFIG_KEYS=y`; exact `__key_link_begin [0xffffffff811b428f,0xffffffff811b437a)` passes `keyring_assoc_array_ops` and directly calls `assoc_array_insert`. This proves compiled reachability, not runtime key policy, attacker-controlled tree shape, callback execution, disclosure, crash, or installed identity.
- The nine-input schema-v2 model leaves incomplete guard facts unknown absent an explicit nonleaf callback path. No target/key syscall, key/keyring state, associative-array mutation, target execution, crash, or privilege action was created. Focused validation passed `8 tests, 524 subtests`; the full suite passed `526 tests, 136161 subtests`, and the public harness passed with `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. Independent exact-binary review returned **REJECTED-BY-FIX-EFFECTS** and final package review returned **ACCEPT**.

## ioprio task-lock checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- CVE-2016-7911 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by same-lock effects matching upstream `8ba8682107ee2ca3347354e018865d8e1967c5f4`; the stripped binary does not establish commit provenance.
- Exact `get_task_ioprio [0xffffffff811f5e7b,0xffffffff811f5ec0)` locks `task +0x630`, then reads `task->io_context +0x678` and `io_context->ioprio +0x12`, and unlocks afterward. Exact `exit_io_context [0xffffffff811eab51,0xffffffff811eab95)` uses the same lock while loading/clearing the pointer and releases the object only after unlock.
- Complete `SyS_ioprio_get [0xffffffff811f616a,0xffffffff811f6371)` contains three direct getter calls. This proves static caller binding, not runtime syscall policy, task permissions, concurrency, or installed identity.
- The eight-input schema-v2 model leaves incomplete fix facts unknown absent an explicit unlocked-read fact. No target or ioprio syscall, task, thread, race, allocation pressure, crash, or target execution was created. Focused validation passed `8 tests, 267 subtests`; the full suite passed `518 tests, 135637 subtests`, and the public harness passed with `pass=3 info=4 pending=0 blocked=0 fail=0`. Independent review returned **ACCEPT** after correction and re-review.

## block seq-iterator lifetime checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- CVE-2016-7910 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by the same cleanup-side compiled effect as upstream `77da160530dd1dc94f6ae15a981f24e5f0021e84`. The stripped binary cannot distinguish a direct cherry-pick, the stable backport, or an independently applied identical source change.
- Complete exact ranges are `disk_seqf_next [0xffffffff811f2c92,0xffffffff811f2cb4)`, `disk_seqf_start [0xffffffff811f2cb4,0xffffffff811f2d26)`, and `disk_seqf_stop [0xffffffff811f2d26,0xffffffff811f2d56)`. Successful start stores the iterator at `seq_file.private +0x78`; allocation failure skips that store.
- Stop loads the same field, calls exact `class_dev_iter_exit` and `kfree` on the iterator, then executes a pointer-width zero store to `+0x78` before return. A later failed start followed by framework stop therefore sees null rather than the freed iterator.
- Both exact operation tables use this stop routine; `/proc/partitions` reaches the shared start through `show_partition_start`, while `/proc/diskstats` uses it directly. `CONFIG_BLOCK=y` and `CONFIG_PROC_FS=y` establish static availability, not installed runtime access.
- The eight-input schema-v2 model is tri-state where needed: incomplete fix facts leave retention unknown unless a freed-pointer-retained fact is explicitly supplied. Installed identity, proc visibility, allocation failure, stale use, repeated free, crash, corruption, root and persistence remain unobserved; no proc entry, allocation pressure, or target code was exercised. Independent review **ACCEPT**; focused validation `10 passed, 267 subtests`; complete validation `510 passed, 135370 subtests`; public harness **PASS**.

## netlink dump ownership checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- CVE-2016-9806 is rejected for exact recovered `vmlinux` by machine-code effects equivalent to upstream `92964c79b357efd980812c4de5c1fd2ec8bb5520`.
- Complete exact `netlink_dump [0xffffffff814a74f7,0xffffffff814a7741)` captures `cb->module` and `cb->skb` while holding the callback mutex, clears `cb_running`, unlocks, then gives only the saved register values to exact `module_put` and `consume_skb`.
- Post-unlock cleanup does not reload the reusable callback fields, so a new dump cannot redirect this invocation's cleanup to its objects. The old banner is not authoritative: pristine 4.1.27 source has the vulnerable reload order, while this downstream binary has the fix effects.
- The seven-input schema-v2 model is tri-state where needed: incomplete fix facts leave the vulnerable reload premise unknown rather than asserting it. The authoritative recovered map is `work/eu-260128/kallsyms.tsv` (SHA-256 `2cfba917c1c8e7444e393e8d94ebfe367e2ba348be4f35ce10fbb331822e3c1f`), with the range also checked against the ELF's embedded address vector.
- This rejection is limited to CVE-2016-9806. Installed identity, runtime netlink reachability, concurrency, crash, corruption, privilege and persistence remain unobserved; no socket, request, message, thread or race was created. Independent review **ACCEPT**; focused validation `9 passed, 136 subtests`; complete validation `500 passed, 135103 subtests`; public harness **PASS**.

## perf move-group race checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- V-030 records the exact CVE-2017-6001 mechanism in recovered `vmlinux`: the `perf_event_open` software-group-to-hardware-context path loads `group_leader->ctx` before waiting for old/new context mutexes, then removes/migrates through the saved context without a nonzero reference, identity revalidation/retry, or post-lock move-state validation.
- Exact `perf_event_ctx_lock_nested.isra.60` in the same binary independently contains the safe reference → lock → identity check → unlock/drop/retry discipline, but the move-group path neither calls nor inlines it.
- `CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y`; the exact initialized `perf_event_paranoid` value is 1. Installed identity, mutable runtime policy, production PMU/event support, successful unprivileged event creation, a winning race, stale/dead-context use, controlled corruption, root and persistence remain unobserved.
- Added complete exact FDE evidence, upstream fix `321027c1fe77f892f4ea07846aeae08cefbbb290`, and a nine-input Boolean-only model with an exhaustive 512-state truth table. No syscall, event, thread, race or target execution was performed.

## AF_PACKET frame-count residual checkpoint — 2026-11-03

- Closed the formerly unresolved V1/V2 consequence of the absent `frames_per_block * tp_block_nr` overflow guard. Exact allocation uses the full block count; every logical position bounded by wrapped `frame_max` still yields a vector index below that count and an in-block offset below block size, including wrapped frame count zero.
- Exact RX, TX, poll, readiness, and progression consumers are retained. The separate 32-bit mmap page-count multiplication can understate expected VMA size, but exact `vm_insert_page` rejects addresses at/above `vm_end`.
- Three syntactic signed vector-index edges begin at block count `0x80000001`, but the minimum vector is `0x400000008` bytes and exact `__get_order` yields order 23. Exact `__rmqueue`/`__alloc_pages_nodemask` reject every order above 10, so `__kmalloc` returns null before block allocation, cleanup, publication, or mmap. These edges are predicate-infeasible.
- The missing guard is now classified as a correctness/early-rejection gap, not a defensible frame-lookup corruption/root primitive. Independent review **ACCEPT**; focused validation `11 passed, 23 subtests`; complete validation `483 passed, 134451 subtests`; public harness **PASS**.

## Keystore status gates and boot-manifest parser checkpoint — 2026-11-02

- `CONFIG_KEYSTORE_SECURE_BOOT_IGNORE=y` removes platform secure-boot-status prerequisites from exact `keystore_init` and `keystore_register`; it does not remove the separate manifest initcall or `verify_oem_signature → SHA-256 → manifest_key_verify_digest` chain.
- Matching Intel-authored public source at vendor commit `0c9640bba6a841f524f5947d0741386792674577` confirms Kconfig intent and that the full command-line spelling is `ABL.oemkm=<size>@<physical-address>`. The target differs in registration logging/helper ABI, so exact binary evidence remains authoritative.
- The manifest parser accepts copied size `1..0x4000000`, conditionally reads header/extension data without binding the internal length to that copy, and can reach an OOB read within its 101-entry/16-bit-stride cap.
- A parse-error path overwrites the allocation pointer with `base + 0x24` and later passes that interior cursor to `kfree`, creating a conditional boot-time invalid-free/crash-or-corruption candidate. Runtime control of the loader parameter and physical-memory blob, controlled corruption, code execution, first root, boot acceptance, and persistence remain unproved.
- `keystore_init` also mishandles class/device `ERR_PTR` failures as non-NULL and can return false success; this is weak state handling, not a demonstrated privilege route.
- Independent review **ACCEPT**. Focused validation: `13 passed, 2084 subtests`; complete validation: `472 passed, 134428 subtests`; public harness **PASS**.

## GStreamer FLIC backport checkpoint — 2026-11-02

- Rejected the CVE-2016-9634/9635/9636/9808 FLIC write-bounds family and CVE-2016-9807's `flx_decode_chunks` invalid-read mechanism for exact recovered `libgstflxdec.so` despite embedded GStreamer `1.8.3-r0` metadata.
- Both complete affected FDEs contain the later comprehensive GstByteReader/GstByteWriter rewrite: bounded frame/chunk sub-readers, frame-sized output writer, checked FLI/FLC cumulative positions, checked reads/writes, and helper failure propagation to `GST_FLOW_ERROR` before publication.
- The invalid-read result remains distinct from write corruption even though the same comprehensive rewrite fixes both. Independent review of the CVE-2016-9807 extension returned **ACCEPT**; original family review was accepted in commit `6ff6452`.

## GStreamer VMNC backport checkpoint — 2026-11-02

- CVE-2016-9445 and CVE-2016-9446 are rejected for exact recovered `libgstvmnc.so` even though its embedded recipe path says GStreamer `1.8.3-r0`.
- The complete packet-parser FDE binds WMVi width/height to unsigned 16-bit fields. Every feasible WMVi route checks each against 16384 before the handler; a syntactic bypass edge is predicate-infeasible because it requires the earlier WMVi comparison to be false while `%edi` remains unchanged. Either oversized dimension returns `-1`.
- The handler accepts only 8/16/32-bit depth, assigns bytes-per-pixel as 1/2/4, copies the guarded rectangle dimensions into the allocation fields, and calls `g_malloc0`; the maximum accepted product is `0x40000000`. Both effects of upstream commit `4cb1bcf1422bbcd79c0f683edb7ee85e3f7a31fe` are present.
- Added exact evidence and a bounded deterministic model. This rejects only these two mechanisms; it does not establish general VMNC/media safety or production invocation.

## IPv6 append-data bounds checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- V-029 records exact CVE-2017-9242 pre-fix ordering with `CONFIG_IPV6=y`: `udpv6_sendmsg` reaches the append wrapper and complete `__ip6_append_data` allocates/copies before calculating and rejecting negative remaining copy.
- The later `-EINVAL`/`kfree_skb` cleanup cannot prevent any overwrite caused by the earlier `skb_copy_and_csum_bits` call. Branch-complete review found no equivalent of upstream early-reject commit `232cd35d0804cc241eb887bb8d4d9b3b9881c64a`.
- This is an exact local kernel OOB-write candidate, not root. Required internal skb/fraggap state, actual overwrite, crash, controlled corruption, code execution, privilege gain and persistence remain unobserved.
- Added authoritative, selected and branch-complete evidence plus a six-input Boolean-only model and 64-state tests. Focused validation passed `7 tests, 77 subtests`; independent semantic/model review returned **ACCEPT**.

## Inotify rename-race checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- CVE-2017-7533 is rejected for the exact recovered kernel despite the `4.1.27-abl` banner and `CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER=y`.
- Exact `__fsnotify_parent` and `vfs_rename` take stable dentry-name snapshots before notification; inline names are copied under the dentry lock, external names retain an owner reference, and release occurs after use. These are the effects of upstream fix `49d31c2f389acfe83417083e1208422b4091cd9e`.
- Exact `inotify_handle_event` still has separate length and copy operations, but the reviewed producers no longer pass the concurrently mutable name required by this CVE. The rejection does not generalize to unrelated fsnotify defects.
- Added reviewed evidence, the authoritative patch, a seven-input Boolean-only model and a complete 128-state truth table. Focused validation passed `7 tests, 142 subtests`; independent semantic/model review returned **ACCEPT**.

## AppLauncher on-demand launch checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- **V-028 overturns the just-recorded V-009 negative.** Exact Request adaptor and relocation evidence shows exported `launch(appid, appname, applocation, ...)` methods pass the caller's runtime path to dispatcher `[0x1ffd0,0x205b3)`. It overwrites AppProcess program field `+0x58`, sets direct-launch byte `+0x1c`, and reaches a `QProcess::start` call site without either identified verifier call. A literal scan of fixed `/navi` paths could not exclude this QString input.
- The correction is two-sided: both exact verifier branches treat false as terminal. The defect is the separate on-demand dispatcher, not fail-open behavior after either verifier returns false.
- The recovered session bus uses EXTERNAL and defaults to the daemon's uid because it has no user connection rule. This is not arbitrary cross-uid access. It is a plausible same-uid/SMACK-domain amplification route for the many configured uid-zero HMI processes only if service ownership, Request-object registration, bus authentication, effective labels, a relevant AppProcess object, QProcess acceptance, exec-time target control/access and effective launcher privilege hold at runtime.
- Added `evidence/applauncher-dbus-launch-bypass.md`, a reviewed instruction/configuration excerpt, Boolean-only model, complete 131,072-state tests, and passive metadata for `Dbuslaunch.service` plus `/tmp/session_appmgr`. No D-Bus request, executable, target launch, credential/label transition, anchor write, update or persistence action was created.

## AppUpgrade routing and trust checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- Recovered `AppUpgrade` is an outer Qt wrapper with exact embedded SCOMO and
  FUMO ELF extents. `tools/uk_fw/embedded_elf.py` now extracts only structural
  extents and keeps outer offsets, embedded offsets, and child VAs separate.
- Exact case-sensitive `-un:1` selects SCOMO; `-un:0` or no `-un:1` selects
  FUMO. The wrapper forwards all arguments except `argv[0]`, starts the child
  asynchronously, ignores setup/child status, and normally returns `1`.
- AppLauncher's dynamic app-ID-300 path is not argumentless: it invokes the
  normal vehicle/model option builder and passes the resulting list to
  `QProcess::start`. The recovered embedded NE/EUR row contains `-un:0`.
  Exact `-un:1` plus app ID 311 conditionally substitutes AppScomoDM for
  AppDMClient.
- FUMO's encryption-mode byte starts at `1`; marker existence at startup changes
  it to `0` and logs `Unencryption Update`. Recovered SCOMO
  MASS_PRODUCT/PENETRATION startup explicitly ignores the marker. This closes
  route selection, not package acceptance: version/model, signature/digest,
  payload write, slot selection, boot trust, health, and mark-good remain
  separate unresolved boundaries.
- Exact AppSetup is only an app-ID-300 initiator. The SCOMO USB owner is
  resolved: AppScomoDM selects a `S5W_SYSTEM_*_*_*.zip`, extracts `AppUpgrade`
  and `.lge.upgrade.xml`, verifies both through a fixed public-key-backed helper,
  decrypts only AppUpgrade on this route, performs a basic ELF/executable check,
  and requests app ID 300.
- The separate FUMO/AppDMClient descriptor path is now partially resolved. It
  reads `<source>/.lge.upgrade.xml`, accepts direct `version` text under
  `lhavn`/`wideavn`, and requires a strict current-version upgrade plus an
  equality-allowed second reference. On the unequal source/destination branch,
  marker absence requires retained AppUpgrade/XML verifier results `0/0` and
  marker presence requires `-404/-404`; exact linked code identifies `-404` as
  no recognized fixed-size `TER`/`TE2` trailer, not successful verification.
  An equal pre-staged path skips both
  checks. Caller reconstruction now proves that path is an intended local
  relaunch: `slotUsbMounted` stores its path in `this+0x128`, standby status 12
  can use fixed `/update/usb/bin`, and a helper relaunches from that directory
  only when the first line of `/update/force_launch` is exact `run`. The inner
  FUMO progress handler attempts that pair in system/firmware progress-zero
  branches after attempting `processing`; the branch-local progress-100 sequence
  attempts `complete` and force value `none`, but later scheduled flow can
  attempt `run` again. The weak writer does not prove successful or atomic
  transitions. Some events are traced through exact `DeltaUpdateProgressHandler`
  routes, so `force_launch=run` alone does not establish completion or
  authentication in the traced write-site evidence. Direct USB control
  of the local staging directory, authentication of the upstream progress
  event, and source stability across separate opens remain unresolved. Reviewed USB
  calls disable one section-zero vehicle comparison, but P5-family and later
  AppUpgrade `car-variant`/target checks remain. See
  `evidence/appdmclient-fumo-usb-eligibility.md`. Numeric-only tool
  `tools/uk_fw/appdmclient_fumo_gate_model.py` models the exact trailer and
  retained-result gates without reading or creating update material.
- Inner-FUMO navigation-map signature handling is now named. Gate `0x128070`
  skips its asynchronous NUA verifier for a dedicated local marker, missing
  NaviUpdateApp/NUA provider, no map candidate, or encryption-mode byte zero. The
  last condition proves `/update/disableEncryptionUpdate` indirectly selects
  this one non-encrypted signature skip after setting the startup mode byte.
  Verification start/result failures stop through `0x127e80`; success sets
  `this+0xd5` and re-enters the gate. This corrects an earlier unresolved data
  flow but does not establish universal package-signature or payload acceptance.
  Added numeric-only `tools/uk_fw/fumo_navi_signature_gate_model.py` and passive
  capture of the dedicated marker.
- **V-020 added and independently corrected:** stock `/usr/bin/unzip` resolves
  to BusyBox SHA-256 `95bab633...bd9ebc`, version 1.23.2. It accepts method 8,
  rejects method 12, and retains CVE-2015-9261's pre-fix `huft_build` `v+n`
  bound before AppScomoDM's two verifier calls. The 1.35.0 BusyBox under the
  current integrated tree is a VM-injected helper and is excluded. The strongest
  supported impact is likely `unzip` child crash/update DoS, not a memory write,
  RCE, root, signature bypass, or accepted update. See
  `evidence/busybox-unzip-cve-2015-9261.md` and
  `tools/uk_fw/busybox_huft_bounds_model.py`.
- No recovered updater/helper was run; no archive or compressed stream was
  created; no package, marker, partition, slot, or VM filesystem was modified.
  See `evidence/appupgrade-update-trust.md`,
  `evidence/appdmclient-fumo-usb-eligibility.md`,
  `docs/agent-work/appupgrade-update-trust/CHECKPOINT.md`, and
  `docs/agent-work/busybox-unzip-bounds/CHECKPOINT.md`.

## Disconnected-bench tooling checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- Added `tools/uk_fw/bench_state_bundle.py`, which emits a reviewable POSIX-shell
  probe that writes only to stdout and parses its serial/console transcript
  offline. It does not mount, start services, alter radios, contact peers,
  signal processes, or write target storage.
- The capture closes the first-evidence gaps shared by V-015 through V-019 and
  the inert Dropbear review: installed hashes, process uid/gid and effective
  SMACK labels, unit state/markers, listeners/interfaces, passive Wi-Fi/P2P
  state, oFono devices, local Bluetooth SDP/profile state, Dropbear-chain files,
  and A/B/update flags. It now also captures the FUMO relaunch lifecycle
  (`force_launch` and completion markers), `/update/sysroot`,
  `/update/usb/upgrade`, `/update/usb/bin`, and hashes/metadata for staged
  AppUpgrade/XML and `/tmp/AppUpgrade`. Missing commands/files remain explicit;
  unreadable files and failed reads, metadata queries, commands, or malformed
  hash output set a nonzero terminal status so the parser fails closed instead
  of returning a complete verdict.
- The generated script is audited for target-write/active-operation commands and
  checked with `sh -n` before emission. Synthetic tests cover timestamps,
  duplicate/incomplete sections, fact derivation, adversarial transcript text,
  CLI mode, and the safety audit. No device, network, radio, modem, or recovered
  target binary was used.
- Added `tools/uk_fw/bench_candidate_triage.py` to classify only completed
  passive reports for V-024 through V-026. The producer now captures
  `/dev/pts/ptmx` and device major/minor identity. PTY confirmation requires an
  effective major-5/minor-2 endpoint, permissions, directory, and devpts mount;
  AF_UNIX module-name state remains explicitly unbound from the current file
  hash. The triage does not establish a race, UAF, corruption, root, or exact
  installed-kernel identity. See
  `docs/agent-work/bench-candidate-triage/CHECKPOINT.md`.
- Hardened `tools/uk_fw/rootfs_patch.py`: archive extraction now rejects absolute
  and parent-traversal paths, duplicates, links, FIFOs/device nodes, unsafe
  injection destinations, and in-place package/manifest overwrite. This protects
  the offline custom-firmware build path but does not solve update acceptance.
- Fable delegation remains unavailable: its catalog entry is not advertised for
  native subagents. DeepSeek Flash remains static-ready, but native dispatch
  rejected the configured model identifier; no route was substituted and no
  private target details were delegated. Generic public-only Astra child
  `6c49c736-1356-475d-8773-8cfd1e1fd4f0` supplied the AF_PACKET proof plan; the
  exact V1/V2 trace is now complete and independently accepted. Earlier generic
  children cover public update-system evidence and passive bench-collector design.

## Filesystem/parser and kernel checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- Added `tools/uk_fw/tuxera_fs_probe.py`, an offline, snapshot-backed, read-only
  harness for exact vendor `tntfs`/`texfat` modules. It rejects path/rootfs
  alias hazards, uses QEMU `readonly=on`, mounts only with
  `ro,nodev,nosuid,noexec`, bounds enumeration, and retains JSON results.
- QEMU xHCI triggers a vendor `xhci_toggle_dis_perr_det()` compatibility fault;
  EHCI plus authentic `ehci-pci` is stable. This is a VM compatibility issue,
  not a production finding.
- Authentic Tuxera exFAT `3016.6.23.3` accepted a clean 64 MiB exFAT control.
  Sixteen upstream malformed exfatprogs fixtures produced three clean rejects
  and thirteen clean bounded mounts; no kernel parser fault was observed. This
  is a small corpus negative result, not a broad safety claim.
- Exact vendor-binary review rejects seven version-derived local-root premises
  for recovered EU `260128`: CVE-2016-0728, Dirty COW/CVE-2016-5195, the
  AF_PACKET races CVE-2016-8655 and CVE-2017-1000111, CVE-2017-7308's
  published private-area primitive, ALSA PCM CVE-2017-0861, and the generic
  Stack Clash missing-gap premise. The shipped code contains the relevant
  keyring reference release, `FOLL_COW`, socket locking, 64-bit
  `tp_sizeof_priv` arithmetic, PCM open mutex, and 1 MiB inter-VMA guard-gap
  backports despite its `4.1.27-abl` banner. Three more unprivileged built-in
  candidates are rejected: CVE-2015-7613's SysV state is initialized before
  publication, CVE-2016-7117's delayed socket error is stored before
  `fput_light`, and CVE-2017-8890's cloned child clears the multicast-list field
  used by teardown. See `evidence/vendor-kernel-socket-ipc-backports.md` and
  boolean-only `tools/uk_fw/kernel_backport_matrix.py`. Physical USB-MIDI
  CVE-2016-2384 is also rejected: `CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m` and both modules
  exist, but exact endpoint failures after raw-MIDI ownership transfer return
  without the second direct object free. Exact `snd-seq.ko` rejects
  CVE-2016-2544; exact `snd-timer.ko` rejects CVE-2016-2545 through
  CVE-2016-2548; and CVE-2016-2549's hrtimer provider is absent. The same timer
  module fixes CVE-2016-4569 and one CVE-2016-4578 callback but retains V-021:
  `snd_timer_user_tinterrupt` queues and returns two untouched four-byte ABI
  padding regions. This is a conditional local information disclosure, not
  root; module load, node/SMACK access, provider/event generation, and observed
  bytes remain unknown. See `evidence/vendor-kernel-alsa-timer-backports.md`
  and `evidence/vendor-kernel-alsa-timer-follow-up.md`. V-022 is a stronger
  remaining local-root candidate: exact `vmlinux` retains CVE-2018-17182's
  32-bit vmacache generations, zero-wrap calls, single-user flush skip, and
  32-bit lookup validation. The generic surface needs no namespace or device,
  but a complete cycle is 2^32 states and no target wrap, stale pointer, UAF,
  corruption, or root transition was executed. See
  `evidence/vendor-kernel-vmacache-cve-2018-17182.md` and Boolean-only
  `tools/uk_fw/vmacache_wrap_model.py`. V-023 is a second exact ordinary-MMU
  candidate: `move_page_tables` transfers PTEs and releases source/destination
  PTLs before the old-range TLB flush at outer exit, matching CVE-2018-18281's
  pre-fix lifetime window. No concurrent invalidation, page release/reuse,
  stale access, corruption, or root is established. See
  `evidence/vendor-kernel-mremap-cve-2018-18281.md`. V-024 retains exact
  CVE-2020-29661 TTY wrong-object locking: a master setter writes the linked
  slave pgrp under the master lock, while the slave setter writes that same
  referenced field under the slave lock. Shipped startup intends world-writable
  `/dev/ptmx`, but runtime exposure, successful concurrency, UAF, and root are
  unobserved. See `evidence/vendor-kernel-tty-pgrp-cve-2020-29661.md`. V-025
  retains exact CVE-2021-0920 semantics in shipped `unix.ko`: both datagram and
  stream MSG_PEEK routes duplicate attached file lists and reach SCM descriptor
  delivery without a barrier on exact `unix_gc_lock`. Module load, GC overlap,
  UAF, corruption, and root remain unobserved. See
  `evidence/vendor-kernel-unix-peek-cve-2021-0920.md`. V-026 retains exact
  CVE-2017-10661 timerfd semantics: membership changes occur outside the only
  global-list lock and no common context lock covers parallel same-file
  transitions. No harmful interleaving, list corruption/UAF, crash, or root is
  established. See `evidence/vendor-kernel-timerfd-cve-2017-10661.md`. V-027
  retains exact CVE-2020-29660 TTY session-lock semantics: `TIOCGSID` reads and
  dereferences the session PID without the control lock/reference while writers
  release before clearing or replacing the same field. The upstream-described
  four-byte read specifically names full preemption, which this voluntary-
  preemption build lacks; no harmful overlap, disclosure, or root is proved.
  See `evidence/vendor-kernel-tty-session-cve-2020-29660.md`.
  CVE-2017-11176 is also rejected by
  exact semantic control flow: `CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE=y`, but failed
  lookup after `netlink_attachskb`'s return-one retry enters skb-only cleanup
  rather than detaching the stale socket. The loop has no explicit register
  clear, demonstrating why opcode absence alone is not a backport test. See
  `evidence/vendor-kernel-mq-notify-backport.md` and numeric-only
  `tools/uk_fw/mq_notify_retry_model.py`. The companion AF_PACKET
  `tp_frame_nr` overflow guard is absent, but its V1/V2 consumer trace is now
  closed: allocation uses full block count and wrapped logical positions remain
  within the vector and block. The separate mmap multiplication fails at exact
  VMA insertion bounds. This is a correctness gap, not an established OOB/root
  path; `CAP_NET_RAW`, installed bytes, and runtime allocation remain separate.
- **V-013 added:** exact `snd-seq.ko` lacks CVE-2017-15265's port use-lock fix.
  A tracked benign diagnostic confirmed numeric uid/gid 65534 can open
  `/dev/snd/seq` and complete one create/delete sequence under the recovered
  `root:root 0644` DAC mode. A bounded race issued 200,000 create and 400,000
  delete attempts without a fault; no UAF, root transition, or code execution
  is claimed. See
  `evidence/alsa-sequencer-cve-2017-15265.md` and
  `tools/uk_fw/alsa_seq_probe.py`.
- ALSA sequencer CVE-2018-1000004 lacks the official Linux 4.1 per-client ioctl
  serialization, but its published sequence requires `write()` while recovered
  intended `/dev/snd/seq` policy is `root:root 0644`. V-013 ioctls working
  through an `O_RDONLY` descriptor therefore do not make that trigger available.
  See `evidence/vendor-kernel-alsa-follow-up-cves.md`.
- Exact IPv4 and IPv6 review confirms pre-fix CVE-2017-1000112 UFO control flow.
  It remains conditional: `CONFIG_USER_NS=n` blocks the published unprivileged
  root setup, production `NETIF_F_UFO` interface features are unknown, and the
  no-NIC VM did not dynamically trigger it. See
  `evidence/vendor-kernel-ufo-cve-2017-1000112.md`.
- A clean 64 MiB NTFS 3.1 control mounted cleanly through exact Tuxera NTFS
  `3016.7.1.2.3`. The V-011 inert-node test is also complete: `tntfs` retained
  character node `1:3`; numeric uid/gid 65534 under SMACK `_` opened it
  read-only without `nodev`, while the `nodev` control returned `EACCES`. Only
  QEMU `/dev/null` was used. This confirms a device-policy bypass primitive, not
  USB-to-root; production opener/SMACK/useful-device reachability remains open.
- Next filesystem work: deterministic copy-on-write exFAT/NTFS mutations and
  production mount-path/SMACK reachability analysis for V-011.

## Security checkpoint — 2026-11-01

- **V-020 added — exact pre-auth removable-update parser defect:** stock BusyBox
  method 8 reaches CVE-2015-9261's pre-fix `huft_build`; `v+n` at `0x4788a`
  permits an uninitialized `v[]` read at `0x47938`, with conditional invalid
  table reads before AppScomoDM authenticates `AppUpgrade` and
  `.lge.upgrade.xml`. Stock method 12 is rejected. Physical route selection,
  effective `PATH`, dynamic target crash, memory write, RCE, SMACK escape, root,
  persistence, package acceptance, and owner applicability remain unknown. See
  `evidence/busybox-unzip-cve-2015-9261.md`.
- **V-015 added — strongest static adjacent-network memory-safety candidate:**
  the recovered RPM Btree identifies `connman-1.29+5w.master.38-r1`, and exact
  shipped instructions confirm CVE-2026-115863 rather than relying on that
  version. `connmand+0x1f150` performs the fixed 1,025-byte DOMAIN_LIST copy and
  unbounded DNS-label cursor/store; exact option-24 dispatch and the connected-
  network RA Managed/Other path are present. The information-request routine
  explicitly requests option 24. The installed service defaults to uid 0,
  intends non-excluded `wlan0`, and restarts on failure. A valid reply still
  needs live transaction/client/server/state agreement. PIE, NX stack, canary,
  and full RELRO are present. No packet, crash, RCE, root transition, or
  installed-device reachability is claimed. See
  `evidence/connman-cve-2026-115863.md`.
- **V-016 added — exact CVE-2023-28488 parser order, but the stack copy is
  fortify-blocked:** ordinary IPv4 startup enters `INIT_SELECTING`, opens the
  `AF_PACKET` L2 listener, and registers the affected callback. The callback
  retains the pre-fix `ip.tot_len - 28` ordering, but exact code calls
  `__memcpy_chk` with object size 628. Every recovered libc implementation
  reviewed branches to `__chk_fail`/`__fortify_fail` before copying an
  underflowed size. A packet-free exhaustive model covered all 43,057,152 length
  pairs. Treat this as conditional adjacent-network ConnMan termination, not a
  stack overwrite, RCE, or root path for recovered `260128`; no packet or
  dynamic abort occurred. See `evidence/connman-cve-2023-28488.md` and
  `tools/uk_fw/connman_length_model.py`.
- **V-017 expanded — exact directional oFono TPDU corruption:** exact
  `ofonod` instructions retain the destination checks fixed by CVE-2023-4232
  through CVE-2023-4235, CVE-2023-2794, and CVE-2024-7547. Incoming vendor-QMI
  calls use `sms_decode(..., FALSE, ...)`; deliver, submit-report, and
  status-report copies complete before the handler's late DELIVER check.
  Deliver-report and command are outgoing-only, but exact local transmit-queue
  and SIM-Toolkit callers use `sms_decode(..., TRUE, ...)`. The expanded
  message-free model exhausts each one-byte length domain and confirms writes
  beyond the `0x128`-byte `sms` object without directly reaching the reviewed
  caller canary. The conditional service defaults to uid 0 with SMACK
  `App::tms`. Activation, byte provenance, dynamic corruption, RCE, SMACK
  escape, unrestricted root, and owner applicability remain unproven. See
  `evidence/ofono-sms-decoder-cves.md`.
- **V-018 added — exact CVE-2024-7537 modem-QMI list bounds:** the exact WMS
  list callback obtains a 16-bit TLV length but never validates it against
  `4 + count*5`. A vendor diagnostic computes the product modulo `2^32`; its
  overflow branch falls through to a four-byte allocation while the loop uses
  the original count. The message-free model proves every count above 13,107
  under-allocates. This is a conditional modem-originated TLV-overread/heap-write
  path, not evidence of direct SMS/base-station control, RCE, or unrestricted
  root. See `evidence/ofono-qmi-message-list-cve-2024-7537.md` and
  `tools/uk_fw/ofono_qmi_list_bounds_model.py`.
- **Two wpa_supplicant P2P candidates rejected by exact code:** recovered
  `/usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant`, SHA-256
  `6ad96a34c09b66c29ed2f9ad7ae73dee8389c81064a30dfd36a1212c52a21212`,
  advertises `v2.5` but contains both reviewed fixes (the CVE-2015-1863 fix
  predates upstream 2.5; CVE-2021-27803 is the later backport).
  `p2p_add_device()` gates every SSID copy on length at most 32
  (CVE-2015-1863), and the Provision
  Discovery Request handler unconditionally re-fetches the peer after
  `p2p_add_device()` (CVE-2021-27803). P2P capability and conditional
  `/tmp/no_unece` launch machinery are present; production find/listen state,
  arguments, interface ownership, SMACK label, and radio delivery remain
  unknown. See `evidence/wpa-supplicant-p2p-cves.md`.
- **Dropbear is inert in recovered `260128`:** the RPM record, socket-fed
  template, public-key installer, and one static root authorized public key
  remain, but `/usr/sbin/dropbear`, `dropbearmulti`, `dropbear.socket`,
  `dropbearkey.service`, the host key, and all enable links are absent. The
  template's `-s` would disable passwords but not root public-key login if the
  missing chain were restored; a bounded recovered-filesystem marker/filename
  search identified no candidate private-key material. Do not infer
  a listener, accepted credential, CVE route, or backdoor from these dormant
  artifacts. See `evidence/dropbear-activation-and-authentication.md`.
- **V-019 added — exact CVE-2017-0782 BNEP bounds in both Bluetooth variants:**
  `BSA0107_00.51.00` and `BSA0107_00.63.00` both read peer-controlled BNEP
  extension/control fields before the field-by-field remaining-length checks
  added by the public fix. PCB 11/12 selects `vbtd-63`; other values select
  `vbtd-51`. The unit is enabled, has a configured uid-0 default, restarts
  always, and recovered policy intends `App::bluetooth` if started. Both profile
  files say `PAN : N/A`, startup calls `BNEP_Init`, and no direct
  `BNEP_Register` reference was
  found, so treat V-019 as dormant pending profile/PSM evidence. Adapter state,
  pairing/authorization, accepted channel, physical delivery, allocation-bound
  OOB, disclosure, RCE, SMACK escape, owner PCB, and installed hash remain unknown.
  No radio or packet was used. See `evidence/broadcom-bsa-bluetooth-cves.md`.
- Added `tools/uk_fw/rpm_nvra_inventory.py`, a strict read-only parser for
  printable Berkeley DB dumps. A compatible project-local Berkeley DB 18.1.40
  dump of the exact `Nvra` index produced 1,679 records; the dump and complete
  inventory remain under ignored `work/`. Package metadata is identity/triage
  evidence, not a vulnerability verdict.
- **V-014 added — strongest static physical root path; benign synthetic activation confirmed:** exact shipped
  `v4l_id` and `scsi_id` instructions contain CVE-2026-40225's pre-fix direct
  property prints. Installed rules import both helpers, tag block devices for
  systemd, and retain generic `REMOVE_CMD` execution. The image also ships
  `debug-shell.service`, configured to start `/bin/sh` as root on `/dev/tty9`
  when `ConditionPathExists=/dev/tty9` passes; the upstream SCSI route can
  inject `SYSTEMD_WANTS` to request that existing unit. A fixed benign offline
  `udevadm test` control confirmed the exact rule engine retains a leading-space
  second `SYSTEMD_WANTS` line as a separate property. A matched VM control then
  used exact `systemd-udevd` and exact PID 1 systemd: only the positive synthetic
  property started an otherwise-unreferenced transient BusyBox marker unit; the
  negative run did not. The installed vulnerable helper rules were masked and no
  pre-existing property-selected unit was requested. A separate control confirmed `/dev/tty9` exists
  as `root:root` mode `0600`, character device `4:9`; it did not start the shell
  service. No malicious-device event, physical root transition, VT9
  interaction, or applicability to the owner's unknown installed build is
  claimed. PID 1's
  banner reports `225`, while embedded build paths say `1_249.3-r0`; exact
  instructions, not either version string, establish pre-fix code. See
  `evidence/systemd-udev-cve-2026-40225.md`.
- Added `tools/uk_fw/privilege_surface.py`, a deterministic read-only extracted-
  rootfs audit tool. Its ignored `260128` report walked 236,552 entries and 102
  service files, finding no host-visible setuid/setgid files, 129 executable
  files with writable extracted metadata (mostly `/navi`, normally mounted
  read-only), zero writable directories, and 46 permissive/non-root udev rule
  assignments. Host file-capability coverage is unavailable and explicitly
  reported, not treated as absence. See
  `evidence/privilege-surface-static-audit.md`.
- **V-006 corrected:** QEMU `usb-mtp` exercised the authentic udev → root
  `usb-automount` → `system()` chain. `ID_SERIAL_SHORT` is reduced to
  `[A-Za-z0-9#+\-.:=@_]`; the old `${IFS}`/separator payload became underscores
  and did not execute. Retain V-006 as unsafe shell construction and possible
  denial of service, not a demonstrated USB-to-root path on `260128`.
- **V-012 service reachability confirmed:** the shipped GStreamer ASF plugin
  `libgstasf.so` (`05e887...f45d`) is dynamically affected by CVE-2026-2920.
  Authentic `gst-discoverer-1.0` exits 139, and the normal uid-0 PlayerEngine
  D-Bus service now reaches the same parser with the corrected nested option
  `{"option":{"mediatype":"audio"}}`. A 32-stream file returns true and
  survives; 33- and 34-stream files return true and terminate PlayerEngine with
  signal 11. This proves manual service reachability and process death in the
  isolated VM, not RCE, automatic USB/indexer invocation, or installed-unit
  reachability.
- QEMU has no soundcard. Stock `alsasink` / `media_mixer` therefore rejects even
  valid WMA. The successful service controls use a disposable VM-only
  `/etc/asound.conf` mapping `pcm.media_mixer` to ALSA `type null`, preserving
  the stock sink factory and device name. Under that environment a `file://` URI
  succeeds while a plain path returns false.
- Exact vendor instructions correct the public-source-only overwrite model:
  `AsfStream` stride is `0xd0`/208, not 200. The 33rd stream zeros the low 32
  bits of `flowcombiner`; the first observed fatal use is
  `gst_flow_combiner_add_pad -> g_queue_push_head+0x1d`, with
  `libgstasf.so+0xb6cc` as the return address.
- Tracked tooling remains `tools/uk_fw/asf_stream_probe.py` plus
  `tests/test_asf_stream_probe.py`. Primary write-up and minimal reviewed
  excerpt: `evidence/gstreamer-cve-2026-2920.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/media-candidates/playerengine-asf-service-evidence.txt`.
- LightMediaScanner's automatic startup route is now separated from V-012. With
  the 33-stream file under `/media/usb/probe`, authentic startup scanning loaded
  its own direct-I/O `asf.so` metadata plugin, reported `processed=1` and
  `errors=0`, wrote its database, and remained alive. The plugin has no
  GStreamer dependency, and a full session-bus capture showed no PlayerEngine or
  thumbnail call. This is a route-specific negative result, not broad media
  safety evidence.
- **V-012 thumbnail route corrected and narrowed:** exact static analysis now
  maps `MediaBrowser requestThumbnails(as)` to
  `com.lge.thumbnailextractor.service.Start(as)`, then
  `VideoContext → uridecodebin → eligible asfdemux`. The earlier assumption that
  `.wma` `Start` followed the audio/TagLib path was wrong; the audio context is
  for cover art. The route is explicit but request-driven. Exact AppMediaPlayer
  review recovers the generated sync/async methods and vtable slots, but its
  reviewed `BrowserInterface -> MediaModeController` scan-handler bodies do not
  directly dispatch them. `VideoPlaybackModel` emits its inherited
  `BasePlaybackModel::thumbnailChanged` signal to `VideoPlaybackController`; the
  connected slot contains no direct thumbnail request. Bounded VM attempts
  observed neither a delivered `Start` nor `libgstasf` in the thumbnail process.
  This is not automatic USB/UI reachability or a thumbnail crash. Reviewed client
  evidence:
  `evidence/artifacts/media-candidates/appmediaplayer-thumbnail-caller-evidence.txt`.
- Next security work: preserve V-014's remaining physical-helper/port/VT gates
  for a disconnected bench rather than starting the root shell. For V-020,
  passively capture installed BusyBox/AppScomoDM hashes, `unzip` provider,
  effective `PATH`, selected `-un` route, uid, and SMACK label; do not put a
  malformed update archive on the owner unit. For V-015, keep
  the current VM NIC-free and defer even benign RA/DHCPv6 controls until the
  disconnected bench can record the installed binary, interface/IPv6 state, and
  restart/recovery behavior. For V-016, record installed `connmand` and libc
  hashes plus ordinary IPv4/ConnMan ownership before considering a crash-only
  control; exact fortification already closes the reviewed stack-write claim.
  For V-017/V-018, first record installed `ofonod`, unit/marker state,
  uid/SMACK label, modem devices, QMI services, benign SMS reception,
  SIM-Toolkit state, and benign stored-message enumeration; keep any later fault
  control crash-only and disconnected, and do not collapse modem-originated QMI
  metadata into direct radio reachability. For Wi-Fi/P2P, passively capture the
  installed supplicant hash, `/tmp/no_unece`, exact arguments, process label,
  interface ownership, and find/listen state; the two reviewed P2P CVEs are
  already fixed. For V-019, capture PCB selection, patchram, installed `vbtd`,
  adapter/profile/SDP state, bond and authorization policy, process label, and
  restart behavior before any malformed radio control. For Dropbear, passive
  file/unit/socket/listener checks are sufficient unless an owner image differs
  from the inert recovered filesystem. Continue identifying an authentic caller
  of V-012 `requestThumbnails` outside
  the now-reviewed scan/property paths—especially QML-facing ownership and
  indirect virtual/callback dispatch—or playback after indexing, and repair the
  VM-only thumbnail service-registration boundary; analyze allocation/lifetime
  behavior without developing a payload. Keep physical bench tests
  non-destructive until recovery and service restart behavior are validated.

## Breakpoint capability matrix complete — 2026-10-29

Eleven checks, 3.94 s, exit 0. Every capability question EC-02 had deferred is now
measured rather than argued:

| Capability | Result |
| --- | --- |
| execute breakpoint fires at armed address | yes, `DR6.B0` set |
| four slots at once | fire in program order |
| slot replacement | yes |
| `DR4`/`DR5` | rejected, `EIO` |
| `DR6` per-slot bits + clearable | yes (`B0` then `B1`, clear reads back 0) |
| detach with slot armed | tracee **killed by `SIGTRAP`** — disarm is mandatory |
| disarm, verify, detach | safe |
| single step | works |
| **per-thread scoping** | **debug registers are per thread; a sibling re-running the same function is unaffected** |

The last item matters most for the design: observing one main thread is sound and
needs neither thread-group control nor `PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE`.

Not tested: data read/write watchpoints, many-thread behaviour, and the vendor
libEGL observation points themselves.

## Breakpoint behaviour and detach discipline measured — 2026-10-29

Round 2 of the capability probe (`dr_breakpoint_probe.c`, 9 checks, 3.85 s,
exit 0) closed the behaviours round 1 left open.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| four slots armed (`DR7`=0x455) | fire in program order, correct RIPs, **only if each fired slot is disarmed before resume** |
| slot replacement | slot 0 fired at a second address after reprogramming |
| `DR4`/`DR5` | rejected, `errno` 5 (`EIO`) |
| detach with a slot armed | **tracee killed by `SIGTRAP`** — kernel does not clear `ptrace_bps` |
| disarm, verify readback, detach | tracee completes, exit 0 |

Two consequences worth carrying forward:

- EC-02's **C-09** concern is confirmed, not defensive. Detach alone is unsafe.
- EC-02 fixture **V-03** was wrong: there is no fifth slot reachable through
  `DR4`, so a capacity test cannot use it.

Remaining unexercised: per-TID scoping (one traced thread while a sibling runs the
same code) and `DR6` semantics beyond `B0`. EC-02's specification blockers are
unchanged and remain the gate to EC-03.

## Guest hardware breakpoints proven — 2026-10-29

The load-bearing unknown behind EC-02 is resolved by measurement, not by more
specification: the guest **honours `DR0`/`DR7` execute breakpoints** via ptrace
under QEMU TCG with the measured `4.1.27-abl` kernel.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| T1 nothing armed | tracee exits 0, no trap |
| T2 `DR0`=target, `DR7.L0` | `DR7` 0x0 -> 0x401; `SIGTRAP` at RIP == armed address `0x1002eb0`; `DR6`=0x1 (B0) |
| T3 restore then continue | tracee exits 0, no re-trap |
| T4 `PTRACE_SINGLESTEP` | RIP advanced `0x10040be` -> `0x10040c1` |

Run cost: **3.64 s**, exit 0, no timeout, synthetic busybox workspace with the
measured kernel and the documented `--sdhci-compat` adaptation.

- Source: `tools/uk_fw/guest/dr_breakpoint_probe.c`
  (`f3244f77cca66c9bac87f207885ac76c9e82af893c949e31216ec4c14e7c29bf`)
- Evidence: `navigation-contract-audit/dr-capability-261029/summary.json`
- Workspace builder: `work/vm/dr-probe-build/build_workspace.py`

**Consequence:** EC-02 was never blocked on capability, only on specification.
The EC-04 fixture that the question was deferred to is cheap and needs no vendor
userspace. Remaining EC-02 blockers are spec defects alone.

**Bounds:** proven on a synthetic tracee at user addresses, not on vendor libEGL
observation points. Four-slot capacity, slot replacement, `DR6` semantics beyond
`B0`, and detach-time teardown of `ptrace_bps` remain unexercised. No vendor
binary was executed and no navigation state is claimed.

## EC-02 blocked by over-specification — 2026-10-29

The EGL copy-measurement work has not advanced to implementation. EC-02, the
non-patching hardware-breakpoint mechanism, has now failed lead review four
times. Attempts so far:

| Round | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | REQUEST_CHANGES, findings EC-R01..EC-R10 |
| 2 | Partial: EC-R04/05/06/07/09 outstanding |
| 3 | Redesign to a normative `ec02-state-machine.json`; still REQUEST_CHANGES |
| 4 | Still REQUEST_CHANGES on structural defects |

Round 4 defects were real, not editorial: missing pre-arm and subsequent
revalidation failure edges; no `ST_SEIZE -> ST_STOP0` transition and no initial
interrupt; already-forwarded signals left pending and therefore redeliverable;
budget sums disagreeing with their own declarations plus unreachable maxima; a
detach-error terminal falsely reporting "detached"; classifier row shadowing; and
inconsistent single-step routing.

**Diagnosis: over-specification.** The mechanism report grew from 771 to 1,931
lines and gained a 1,187-line state machine for a bounded diagnostic observer.
Each correction exposes a new edge because edge policy is being authored with no
implementation feedback. A fifth textual round would repeat that failure mode.

**Recommendation (owner decision required):** rescope EC-03 to a minimal
verifiable core — `PTRACE_SEIZE`, the four hardware observation points at
`libEGL+0x16f16` / `+0x16f1e` / `+0x16f89` / resolved libc entry, bounded capture,
restoration, and a host-owned timeout — then let the EC-04 fixtures settle the
remaining edge policy empirically.

EC-03 remains gated. Nothing has been measured: no VM boot, no target execution,
no fixture run, and no EGL behaviour claim. The parallel live workstream remains
the now-corrected V-006 root shell sink and the VM-confirmed V-012 ASF parser crash.

## Parallelism/Council checkpoint — 2026-10-27

The next EGL experiment now has a frozen, Council-accepted **plan**, not an
implemented observer or successful measurement. Astra-high led planning; the
three-seat panel (Astra-high, two independent Sol-medium reviewers) completed
independent and reconciliation rounds. Checker outcome is `COMPLETE` for package
fingerprint `c59ac8a0d4ece96fd8fab5fe8a6795789697c95394d6e548a02dc8484052bbb5`.
Packet SHA-256 is
`528649b5b337fb0b76bafd6cb9b020e572851ec33136c6d0927a5c38a12ef790`;
artifacts are under
`navigation-contract-audit/orchestration/council-egl-plan-v1/`.

Critical correction: `-4` proves neither that the original width was `-1` nor
that width changed during the observed update. Measure pre/post fields, update
outcome, EGL call-site arguments, and actual resolved copy-entry arguments.
Downstream contracts must record the vendor EGL and project Mesa module together,
numerical capture caps, debugger-state restoration, and host-owned VM termination.

EC-01/EC-02 are blocked. Workers must use the direct DeepSeek API provider via
a provider-qualified `deepseek/...` route. The live tool rejects
`deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` as unknown; its OpenCode suggestion is explicitly
forbidden, not a fallback. No DeepSeek work ran and no model was substituted.
Do not implement or launch the authentic VM until a supported direct DeepSeek
route is available or the owner explicitly selects another direct model.
The Parallelism ledger is `orchestration/parallelism-ledger.json`.

The scheduler currently lists the prior `keep going` task as **paused**. Another
update attempt failed because interval schedules reject the `time`/`timezone`
fields required by the exposed update schema. No active heartbeat is claimed.

## Continuation records and operating policy — 2026-10-26

Read `PROJECT-OPERATIONS.md` for the same-chat-only continuation contract and
next bounded task. `Ioniq5-CHANGELOG.md` is editable;
`Ioniq5-HISTORY.md` is append-only and now includes a source-labelled
retrospective backfill through the milestones below. Defensive findings,
validation gaps and remediation tests are tracked separately in
`Ioniq5-VULNERABILITIES.md`.

Owner requested retaining the existing active `keep going` scheduled task;
its prompt update was rejected by scheduler-tool validation. No replacement
schedule or successful same-chat binding is claimed. No new threads were created. Installed DeepSeek routing is only
statically checked. **Delegation correction:** inline `spawn_worker` is exposed
and can select a model without creating a chat thread. A useful DeepSeek dispatch
attempt returned host error `store.runWorkerToolResult is not a function`; no
worker result or runtime routing metadata was obtained. Earlier claims that the
interface did not exist were mistaken. Do not duplicate that unknown-status task
or substitute a child thread; host integration needs repair.
Continuation-setup validation: **168 unit tests pass**; `git diff --check` passes.
No fresh VM run or firmware/image mutation was performed during this setup.

Bounded static continuation: `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md`
records that the saved launch-status function sends literal `5` under a one-shot
gate rather than calculating it from the engine result. Exact strings are now
resolved: launcher `launched(30)` precedes a separate AppNavi
`com.lge.hkmc.avn.appnavi.naviboot.SendNaviBootFail(5)` signal at
`/navigation_map`. Enum semantics and the producer of manager window `0` remain
unresolved. Receiver disassembly now identifies `window` as a separately latched
byte at receiver +0x20, gating downstream status handling. The adjacent vendor
`naviWindoeCreate` path updates it and replays cached status. Next trace its
caller at `0x19108d`, not patch the flag or substitute surface ID 3000. That
caller is now identified as the BG-info path. Latest retained DLT positively
shows AppNavi **FG** delivery, but zero BG-info diagnostic matches; the latch
remains zero. Its pending global initially equals `0xffffffff`, not zero. Next
trace initial configure lifecycle. Original compositor classification is now
recovered: **any positive dimension selects FG; BG requires both dimensions
non-positive**. Therefore changing 1926×753 to 1920×720 would not fix this
branch. Current image compositor and shell modules match recovered originals.
Shell size cache starts 0/0 and suppresses unchanged configure calls, so an
initial zero-size surface does not automatically emit BG. Next compare a retained
positive BG lifecycle against AppNavi hide/unmap behavior; do not synthesize BG
or force the latch. Current-image/path hashes are not historical memory digests.
Constructor wiring confirms AppNavi's callback is the same Qt object's
`visibleChanged(bool)`. This historical checkpoint is superseded by the
2026-11-07 exact-static result: surface 3000 is Qt Quick OpenGL/EGL; the forced
basic loop stops hide at `fireAboutToStop()`; the threaded `doneCurrent` route
reaches recovered EGL null attachment/commit. Runtime threaded execution and BG
remain unproved. See the Navigation contract note for addresses, identities and
limits.

## Current VM status — 2026-10-28

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor kernel boot | Working (documented ABL boot-parameter adaptation) |
| Recovered `260128` userspace | Working, mounted read-only |
| Launcher standby → profile confirm | Working, authentic screen |
| Authentic `AppHomeScreen` | Working |
| AppNavi process + map pixels | Partial — renders into its own surface |
| Home ↔ Navigation compositing | **Blocked** — window byte `+0x20` never latched |
| Audio / persistence / suspend | Not started |
| CAN / MICOM | Partial — D-Bus simulation only |
| Input | Partial — Wayland harness, not end to end |

Run configuration is mandatory: TCG, `-cpu max,vendor=GenuineIntel`, 1536 MiB,
disk `snapshot=on`, no NIC. Four inspected screenshots are published under
`vm/evidence/screenshots/` (profile/confirm, Home, a navigation-window frame
still showing Home, and the AppNavi map surface). Root README carries the status
table and the manager/window-byte explanation.

Navigation remains a contract problem: `notifyNaviLaunched[5]` with window byte
`0` caches the accepted status and stops before Navigation callbacks. Only a BG
window notification updates that byte, and the observed runtime delivers FG
only. The later `11/11` state followed the harness's explicit event `302`, reason
`322` Home request; it was not an autonomous fallback. Status `5` is not patched
and no success callback is synthesised.

Secondary open workstream: the early AppCamera/Standby EGL crash when window
decoration is unset (`I-001`), currently a qualified mixed vendor-EGL/project-Mesa
investigation with no stock-device exploitability claim.

## Public VM source record

The authored guest helpers and experiment scripts are copied under `vm/repro/`;
bounded output summaries and two inspected screenshots are under `vm/evidence/`.
Original `work/vm/` references below name local generated artifacts; see
`vm/README.md` for the published mapping and excluded disk images,
recovered vendor binaries, raw logs and core dumps. Older dated sections
remain historical evidence and may have been superseded by later findings.

## Navigation and VM findings

Bounded static continuation: `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md`
records that the saved launch-status function sends literal `5` under a one-shot
gate rather than calculating it from the engine result. Exact strings are now
resolved: launcher `launched(30)` precedes a separate AppNavi
`com.lge.hkmc.avn.appnavi.naviboot.SendNaviBootFail(5)` signal at
`/navigation_map`. Enum semantics and the producer of manager window `0` remain
unresolved. Receiver disassembly now identifies `window` as a separately latched
byte at receiver +0x20, gating downstream status handling. The adjacent vendor
`naviWindoeCreate` path updates it and replays cached status. Next trace its
caller at `0x19108d`, not patch the flag or substitute surface ID 3000. That
caller is now identified as the BG-info path. Latest retained DLT positively
shows AppNavi **FG** delivery, but zero BG-info diagnostic matches; the latch
remains zero. Its pending global initially equals `0xffffffff`, not zero. Next
trace initial configure lifecycle. Original compositor classification is now
recovered: **any positive dimension selects FG; BG requires both dimensions
non-positive**. Therefore changing 1926×753 to 1920×720 would not fix this
branch. Current image compositor and shell modules match recovered originals.
Shell size cache starts 0/0 and suppresses unchanged configure calls, so an
initial zero-size surface does not automatically emit BG. Next compare a retained
positive BG lifecycle against AppNavi hide/unmap behavior; do not synthesize BG
or force the latch. Current-image/path hashes are not historical memory digests.
Constructor wiring confirms AppNavi's callback is the same Qt object's
`visibleChanged(bool)`. This historical checkpoint is superseded by the
2026-11-07 exact-static result: surface 3000 is Qt Quick OpenGL/EGL; the forced
basic loop stops hide at `fireAboutToStop()`; the threaded `doneCurrent` route
reaches recovered EGL null attachment/commit. Runtime threaded execution and BG
remain unproved. See the Navigation contract note for addresses, identities and
limits.

## Newly supplied community leads

`evidence/community-chat-leads.md` reconciles the owner's summary of two Linux
channels with existing research. These are attributed chat reports, not newly
validated methods. Most importantly: decryption is not update acceptance;
`CV_E...220721` is an unverified different-model lead, not an IONIQ rollback
candidate; historical download availability is model/region dependent. Native
userspace recovery is already solved here, so physical AppNavi entry is not a VM
prerequisite. Exact xcrypt/updater-format or hardware-contract artifacts would be
more useful than repeating first-entry research.

## Latest bounded stack/caller capture

A new VM-only ptrace observer captured 64 readable stack words at the Camera
fault in a 43.7-second snapshot run, then re-delivered SIGSEGV. It identifies a
real memcpy call in vendor EGL `dri2_wl_swrast_put_image2`. Width-derived stride
is cached before `swrast_update_buffers`, which can change width; captured
stride/count registers are -4. This is a strong ordering/invalid-size lead, not
yet measured memcpy-entry arguments or a completed fix.

Complete archive SHA-256:
`e0884a3c11582ed2b986db28f2673b7fde9297a1871f2633ad13672b2dfdeaae`.
Source: `tools/uk_fw/guest/ptrace_crash_observe.c`; build, run, bounded disassembly
and summary under `navigation-contract-audit/` in the current VM workspace.
Guest negative tests, real fault capture and all 168 repository tests pass; base
image rehashed unchanged. No independent model review was available.

Track as **I-001** in `Ioniq5-VULNERABILITIES.md`: mixed vendor-EGL/project-Mesa
VM compatibility is a material precondition; stock-device exploitability is not
established. Next capture before/after update dimensions and copy-entry arguments,
then design a checked VM adaptation. Do not patch libc or force Navigation state.

## Prior focused core capture

A 44.83-second snapshot-only early-startup experiment captured an 80 KiB AppCamera
ELF core with eight thread-register notes. The faulting vector store writes
**64 bytes below a writable mapping**, confirmed by SIGSEGV/SEGV_MAPERR and core
program headers. Early-client decoration value is verified as `1`. Original
caller/copy length remains unknown; the core stores no fault-thread stack bytes.
This is not yet a vendor vulnerability or a Navigation fix.

Complete archive SHA-256:
`10fbb21b674ab1795c5e2b52d4e04ad47611f8674c4ac5ed43d283322c24987c`.
See `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md` and
`navigation-contract-audit/early-core-summary.json` under the current VM workspace.
Base image rehashed unchanged. Next capture bounded stack/caller context at the
fault rather than repeat the whole failed Navigation sequence.

## Prior negative environment control — 2026-10-27

A single-variable decoration-unset control completed as a harness but failed
before authentic agreement/Navigation: repeated Camera/Standby crashes, no
AppNavi launch, manager 0/0, all screenshots splash. It did not verify child
value `1` or geometry. **Do not adopt the unset change.** It existed only in
snapshot guest `/tmp`; the base image rehashed unchanged. Archive SHA-256:
`648b5d30c169b2e4adaa2e8cf069742fd5b3d779b0ef1d6d7e63fead7f6910e9`.
See `evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md` for evidence and gaps.
Do not repeat a full navigation run before diagnosing early-client failure;
keep the original working baseline and separate hide-path investigation intact.

## Prior observational backend run — 2026-10-27

A new snapshot-only run completed without timeout and captured 26 AppNavi process
maps. The original launcher-owned process loads the exact analyzed QtWayland
client and EGL graphics plugin. It also inherits
`QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1:1` and loads the decoration plugin; parser
impact remains unverified. No hide fix or synthetic notification was applied.

Authentic Home visibly rendered before Navigation, and the manager followed
`11/11 → 35/11 → 11/11`, with FG delivery and `notifyNaviLaunched[5] window[0]`.
The final `11/11` followed the harness's explicit event `302`, reason `322` Home
request; it is not evidence of an autonomous fallback. **The final return
capture is black**, despite manager state 11/11; this run does not reproduce
visible Home restoration. The older positive Home evidence below
remains valid within its original run. Raw Wayland null-buffer requests were not
captured; setting WAYLAND_DEBUG alone did not establish that coverage.

Complete archive SHA-256:
`6019ec6e42cacce8a41fdc79c7dd9705487efdc0a53b741313e6b5b7aad01d84`.
Artifacts and full evidence: `navigation-contract-audit/` beneath
`work/vm/vendor-userspace-260128/`, and
`evidence/navigation-launch-status-contract.md`.
Base rootfs rehashed unchanged; 168 tests pass. Next capture genuine hide/null-
attach execution without changing behavior, and resolve the duplicated decoration
environment independently. Full Home↔Navigation acceptance remains open.

## Prior Home→Navigation integration finding

A launcher-local `execve` interposer now adds the EGL shim only to the original,
signature-checked `/navi/Bin/AppNavi`; it does not directly start a duplicate
navigation process and does not propagate the preload to other vendor clients.
In the latest completed run, the original AppLauncher-owned PID `908`:

- passed AppLauncher's signature check and remained its registered AppID `30`
  process;
- reached `### Navi Engine Init Success ###` and selected the expected logical
  `Samples: 2` config through the executable-scoped zero-MSAA translation;
- created parent surface `3000` with `AID(AppNavi)` and child surface `4903`;
- stayed alive through all four Navigation observations after the launcher-local
  shim suppressed only AppLauncher's slow-TCG `SIGTERM` liveness action.

Static analysis also identified AppNavi's exact startup deadline. In
`NimoExSLApplicationLinux::onInitializeDone()` at `0x33b48be`, elapsed startup
is compared with `0x59d7` (22,999 ms). If `g_firstTimeHideByWM` is already true
or elapsed time exceeds that threshold, the code invokes
`SendToAppLauncherNaviLaunchedToExcute()`. An exact-build, sentinel-gated,
executable-scoped runtime adaptation changed only that immediate to 180,000 ms
in memory; the signed executable on disk remains unchanged. The latest run
proved the guard and PIE-base calculation: AppNavi logged
`STARTUP_DEADLINE_22999_TO_180000_MS`, completed initialization at 106,464 ms
without taking the timeout branch, created surface `3000`, and only then entered
the launch-status function after the authentic first-window event.

That ordering control did **not** complete Navigation. The launch-status path
emitted the sender member named `SendNaviBootFail(5)` and ApplicationManager
logged `notifyNaviLaunched[5] window[0]`; manager state remained current/drawing
`35/11`, and all bounded Navigation captures continued to show authentic Home.
The explicit event `302`, reason `322` return request restored manager state
`11/11` and visible Home. Later exact receiver analysis supersedes the old
status ambiguity: `5` is accepted, while window `0` gates callbacks. The current
blocker is genuine BG-driven latch/replay and the threaded EGL runtime sequence,
not status fabrication or an autonomous fallback.

Latest completed evidence:

- runner SHA-256
  `906e734012a9a9cac35aed2e9258674215b407a93cdce9e58024a2f78bf8dd9f`;
- host log SHA-256
  `de9977d671cb203f918d878f939777c1eea330bad90dd2ca0643b6ba57c60021`;
- complete archive SHA-256
  `a0e2100ca5a0eb72426db6179c88a27e34abe5928d8a364ce9f14d0e9bfd52b8`;
- state sequence `11/11 → 35/11 → 11/11`;
- current rootfs SHA-256
  `4953a005683e009e84390bbf07d65a6a3313cc6abd692a3023e6b660066d036f`.

The immediately preceding targeted-preload run is useful partial evidence for
AppLauncher-owned surface creation, but its 570-second host timeout interrupted
the archive stream. It is explicitly retained as partial evidence and must not
be cited as a complete archive.

## Latest standby/input and Home finding

Global two-thread llvmpipe permits the delayed authentic Confirm flow that
softpipe starved. The latest bounded run corroborates the gate semantically and
then reaches visible Home:

- the injected pointer remains focused on authentic `AppStandbyClock`, and its
  transformed coordinate `(822.5625, 658.875)` lies inside the enabled Confirm
  control at `x=471..1179`, `y=621..699`;
- authentic logs show `confirmSkPressed()`, `onPressedButton`, `onReleased`, and
  `HANDLER_CONFIRMSCREEN_BUTTON_CONFIRM_CLICKED`;
- standby status changes from `14` to `12`;
- ApplicationManager explicitly reports
  `is_standby_agree_pressed standbyStatus[12] result[1]`;
- both display-exception checks clear:
  `DisplayExceptionFilter a_nMask[66] ret=[0]` and mask `161` `ret=[0]`;
- the handler's intermediate AppID `35` is now dynamically named
  `APP_NAVI_LOADING`, not an unknown setup/profile application;
- ApplicationManager then selects current AppID `11`, requests
  `requestShow AppId[APP_HOME][11]`, receives the authentic Home response
  `ret[1]`, and later records current and drawing application `11`;
- IVI creates run-specific Home surface `1001`, foregrounds it, and the final
  1920×720 capture visibly shows the authentic Home vehicle/battery/media page.

The immediate D-Bus transition out value remains `255`. It can no longer be
classified as rejection by itself: the same request proceeds asynchronously
through current AppID `11`, Home `ret[1]`, drawing AppID `11`, IVI foreground,
and visible composition. Use the downstream state and response chain, not the
immediate integer alone, to classify the transition.

Two explicit VM compatibility adaptations remain material. First, global
`llvmpipe` with two worker threads lets Qt dispatch the queued gesture. Second,
a bounded 55-second `SIGSTOP` of **ApplicationManager only**, after it has sent
authentic `requestShow(APP_HOME)`, prevents its production four-second liveness
watchdog from killing Home while x86 TCG software rendering creates the first
frame. No alive reply, agreement state, handler invocation, application ID, or
Home frame is fabricated. AppStandbyClock and AppHomeScreen binaries remain
unmodified; observational/sizing QML overlays, the 120-second AppLauncher timer,
and the zero-MSAA AppNavi compatibility copy are still non-production VM
adaptations.

Primary positive evidence:

- runner SHA-256
  `25a2ee9726d160c03b52c8dc3c5a76aaba33dd57d7d4be7ecba6f9b2f34485ae`;

- evidence archive SHA-256
  `87d81b278f8b1bb20236faedd17dda0493b49b6cfc1e0fd2f1acfe8b8d2c6f5e`;
- visible final Home screenshot SHA-256
  `23ccd6e6002d8bceddac3a64b2c94538cb844cc9aa274b44d18ada876d2cc968`.

The earlier focus, Loader, QtWayland, and RIP-sampling archives remain the
canonical negative controls explaining why softpipe did not dispatch the
button. Their SHA-256 values are respectively `dbede61e…ac28`,
`4140b3b8…f134`, `c72c487b…3b73`, and `73cda7a0…c08`.

This top section supersedes the older 2026-10-21 continuation retained later in
this file for provenance. See `evidence/corrections-log.md` before quoting older
negative conclusions.

## What currently works

| Milestone | Measured result / boundary |
|---|---|
| Vendor kernel | EU package Linux `4.1.27-abl`, x86-64; not Android; one exact-build PCI-table adaptation occurs **in guest RAM** |
| Firmware recovery | Validated native TE2/xcrypt envelope decryption recovered rootfs, GUI, AppNavi, updater and RW-data userspaces from official EU `260128` packages |
| Authentic home HMI | `AppHomeScreen` renders a completed 1920×720 frame through recovered Weston/IVI and project-local Mesa 18 `softpipe`; pointer and touch reach authentic Qt/QML |
| Authentic launcher identity | `AppLauncher 3` launches AppNavi as AppID `30`, path `/navi/navi/Bin/AppNavi`, parent IVI surface `3000` |
| Navigation engine | A bounded authentic EU map parcel/core subset reaches `### Navi Engine Init Success ###` |
| Visible navigation pixels | Isolated AppNavi renders its authentic 836×720 map-widget surface `4903`; a compositor capture shows roads, water, buildings and the vehicle marker |
| Authentic full chain | VM-only `AskSysBootinfo` makes AppLauncher select HMC / vehicle `0x26` / Europe / RHD / 12.3-inch / English. Authentic Confirm advances status to `12`, agreement predicate to true, filter results to zero, and manager current/drawing AppID to Home `11`; run-specific surface `1001` is visibly foregrounded |
| Qt/Wayland environment | Removing the probe's pre-set shell variable fixes `ivi:ivi`; clients load `libivi.so` and report `Using the 'ivi' shell integration` |
| Remaining boundary | Full Home↔Navigation operation is not yet demonstrated. The latest AppLauncher-owned AppNavi reaches engine/EGL success and surfaces `3000`/`4903`, but `notifyNaviLaunched[5] window[0]` leaves manager state at `35/11`; data-bearing micom/CAN and persistence contracts remain incomplete |

The primary visible-navigation capture is:

- run `1792908755653936000`;
- PNG `1920×720`, with the native `836×720` map widget at `(0,0)` and the
  still-black AppNavi parent region to its right;
- SHA-256
  `88e8403d808b6936181465ee512aa9e124b75ccc7dbd625a221e41e75ab8b4cb`;
- evidence manifest:
  `work/vm/vendor-userspace-260128/ivi-link-navi-widget-build/visible-navigation-milestone.json`.

The capture is genuine AppNavi-rendered map content, but it is not a complete
navigation UI. The VM-only IVI helper reconstructs the missing relationship
`3000 -> 4903`, restores child destination `836×720`, and foregrounds parent
`3000`. Without that relationship, surface `4903` had a `1×1` destination or
sat behind the opaque black parent. The 40 pure-white pixels seen in earlier
black captures are the Weston cursor, not navigation content.

The earlier baseline launcher-chain experiment was run `1792936845027660000`.
A narrow, fail-closed VM simulator supplies the exact 35-byte
`com.lge.car.micom` `/Ihu` `AskSysBootinfo` reply and acknowledges only
introspection-confirmed transport methods; it does not fabricate CAN signals.
AppNavi reaches engine success, parent `3000`, and map child `4903`; Home reaches
`SCREEN_STATE: DRAW FINISHED` and surface `1004`. The final screenshot remains
the splash hash `b316a82a…0b9a83`. The later AppNavi `SIGTRAP` is explained by
ApplicationManager spawning `killall -5 AppNavi` after repeated failed liveness
checks, not by an unexplained spontaneous crash. A direct-launch no-`strace`
control (run `1792937492664474000`) reproduces the same kill: AppNavi answers
its initial D-Bus `Peer.Ping` at `/navigation_map`, then leaves eight later
Pings unanswered. Tracing adds latency but is not the sole cause. Full evidence
and boundaries:
`work/vm/vendor-userspace-260128/micom-contract/BOOTINFO-AND-SIM-V2.md`.

The boot-image file remains unchanged. Call the running kernel a
**VM-adapted vendor kernel**, not a complete stock-firmware boot. Synthetic
`ABL.oemkm` / `ABL.seed` inputs initialize keystore and manifest subsystems;
they are not recovered device keys or proof of a trust bypass.

## Current constraints

- User-owned UK 2021 IONIQ 5 Ultimate head unit, disconnected from the vehicle.
  **No physical or network access to it is available.** Its installed firmware
  version remains unconfirmed.
- Prefer existing local EU/AU packages, project-local toolchains and saved
  research. Public source/tool research is allowed, but keep downloads and all
  derived artifacts project-local where tooling permits.
- Keep generated files, VM disks, sockets and test temporaries in this project.
  Do not delete anything outside it; preserve unrelated and pre-existing work.
- No flashing, host-root operations, host filesystem mounts, or substitute
  dashboard presented as the vendor UI.
- Fable was requested as reviewer/planner only. Its tested route was unavailable;
  no substitute child is verified as Fable.
- Unit-test results and evidence hashes are **not Council acceptance**. Do not
  refresh legacy accepted-input hashes to manufacture a pass.

## Current navigation continuation

1. The 11 direct authentic `RES/SKIN` files are now injected. Theme image and
   `SIMPLENIGHT.skn` load successfully. Missing
   `VIT_EUR_3D_LANDMARK.hafmma`, `DEM/VIT_AREA_DATA_HM.cad`,
   `StyleKeyId.sqlite`, and `SymbolCode.sqlite` remain logged, but do not stop
   the first visible map frame.
2. Surface `3000` is AppNavi's 1920×720 Qt parent. Surface `4903` is the
   independently rendered 836×720 `Front_Widget` map surface. Wayland traces
   prove `wl_buffer` attach, full damage, and commit on `wl_surface@17`.
3. The isolated no-`ApplicationManager` run omitted the intended IVI hierarchy.
   `tools/uk_fw/guest/ivi_link_navi_widget.S` reconstructs
   `set_parent_child_surface(3000, 4903)` and the native child destination. It
   is exact-configuration VM infrastructure, not recovered firmware.
4. AppLauncher-first startup now creates the 35-byte `MICOMSTATUSMESSAGE`
   segment and avoids the historical repeated eight-second semaphore timeout.
   A consumer-derived `AskSysBootinfo` profile selects NE/Europe correctly.
   Remaining micom work is the data-bearing query/CAN signal contract, not the
   old semaphore symptom; do not reset or pre-create guessed IPC objects.
5. Binding recovered `/system/new_gui/new2.0/hmc/night` over the incomplete
   legacy image tree removed all 15 named `Failed to load image` messages, but
   produced the exact same screenshot hash. Missing image files are therefore
   not the current cause of the black AppNavi parent region; missing service/UI
   state remains the stronger hypothesis.
6. Do not rename `MAP/VIT_EUR_3D_LANDMARK_ASTC.hafmma` to the missing
   `RES/SKIN/VIT_EUR_3D_LANDMARK.hafmma` without tracing the variant selector.

Current ext4 image SHA-256 after the targeted AppNavi preload and guarded
PIE-aware startup-deadline control:
`4953a005683e009e84390bbf07d65a6a3313cc6abd692a3023e6b660066d036f`.
Every mutation has a copy-on-write checkpoint and `e2fsck -fn` log under
`work/vm/vendor-userspace-260128/`.

## Latest local recovery work

Read `evidence/local-ui-recovery.md` and its retained evidence directory.

1. **Boot public-key hypothesis:** all 12 plaintext EU/AU `ipk.` containers
   share one RSA-2048 public key and pass strict signature controls. Scanning
   the first/last 16 KiB of 38 opaque envelopes, at every byte offset and in
   both byte orders, made **2,392,520 RSA attempts and found no valid type-1
   block**. This tests one key, one padding format and recorded edge ranges,
   not every possible wrapped-key location or algorithm.
2. **Installed Mac updater hypothesis:** static inspection of Navigation
   Updater `261.015.0.215` found text/API AES routines and constants. Two
   reconstructed constant pairs were tested against the same 38 files under
   bounded CBC-start/IV hypotheses. Two raw gzip-marker matches were the same
   invalid sample in both packages; reserved flags and zlib rejected them.
   **No validated firmware plaintext was recovered.** Other crypto modes and
   derivations were not exhausted. The updater was not launched or contacted
   online.
3. **Earlier plaintext searches:** full-byte ELF/gzip/tar probing covered
   7,134,873,011 bytes across 14 opaque payloads with no validated candidate.
   Prefixes of 1,571 regular map ZIP members and two distinct plaintext voice
   archives were also inspected. See the graphics evidence for exact bounds.

`new_gui.tar.gz`, `mango-rootfs.tar.gz`, `appnavi.tar` and updater payloads remain
opaque. The publicly saved `DecryptToPIPE` and key files are placeholders.
The older Chimaera work documents a real decryptor/key-file mechanism, but does
not itself establish current-package applicability or supply those artifacts.
High entropy or a failed bounded scan is **not proof of permanent offline
impossibility**.

## Local continuation 2026-10-22: envelope format, module execution, graphics

Verified offline in QEMU against the unmodified vendor kernel `4.1.27-abl`. Artifacts
under `work/ui-recovery/`, `work/kbuild/`, `work/envelope-20261021/`; full runbook in
`work/ui-recovery/SUMMARY-and-runbook.md`. This does **not** unlock the real UI.

- **Envelope format** (all opaque payloads, incl. `iasImage`): `[ciphertext body]
  [0x00][base-255 zero-free footer]`; the footer is package-scoped and decodes to
  uniform ciphertext (no length prefix, not block-aligned). `iasImage` adds a
  14,048-byte (878-block) deterministic prefix. This corrects the earlier
  "3,385 header + payload + 13,035" model (arithmetic, not structure).
- **Boot key inside the envelope:** type-1 public unwrap is a clean negative; type-2
  is the wrong direction (≈1.5e-5 false positives). No offline key.
- **Plaintext resources** (map ZIPs, voice archives) hold map data, fonts, PNGs and
  ASR/TTS models — **no UI/ELF**. `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD` is unset (no initramfs).
- **Unsigned kernel-module execution works in the stock vendor kernel:** vermagic
  `4.1.27-abl SMP mod_unload`; `MODVERSIONS`/`MODULE_SIG` off. Recipe: build against
  the vendor config, rewrite PLT32→PC32, and shift the `init`/`exit` this_module
  relocations +8 (`struct module` init at 0x130, not 0x128). See
  `work/ui-recovery/SECURITY-FINDING-module-load.md`.
- **Graphics:** a module registers `/dev/dri/card0`, KMS `card0-VGA-1`, **and advertises a
  real 1280x720 mode** with **no Intel GPU** (`drm_mode_probed_add` +
  `drm_mode_connector_list_update`; sysfs iterates `connector->modes` directly, so the
  vendor `funcs->detect` layout mismatch is bypassed). Actual scanout/fbcon still needs
  the vendor's `drm_framebuffer`/CRTC structs.
- **The remaining gate:** the vendor userspace is AES-encrypted in the package; the
  key is `/tmp/<32hex>`, generated on-unit per update by `DecryptToPIPE` (public
  tooling is placeholder-only). On-unit the rootfs/navi are plaintext. Both goals
  (run the real UI; install own apps) need device/rootfs access.

## Historical next useful work (superseded by recovered/decrypted userspace)

#### From the parallel repository

The parallel repository carries these same bullets under the heading
`## Next useful work`. No prose differs between the two lineages in this
section; only the title, and the path substitutions recorded in the
sections above, where raw user paths are replaced by placeholders.

- **Acquire the plaintext vendor rootfs or the per-update key.** This is now the
  single blocker for both goals. Any read access unblocks it: an engineering-mode
  shell, an `mmcblk0p3`/`p5` + navi dump, or the `/tmp/<32hex>` `DecryptToPIPE` key.
  Runbook (dump → decrypt → boot; key-capture; module path) is in
  `work/ui-recovery/SUMMARY-and-runbook.md`.
- Until then, do not re-probe envelope crypto or DRM struct offsets offline: those
  paths are exhausted (device-gated), as recorded above.
- If genuine application code is recovered, inventory ELF architecture,
  dynamic loader/libraries, launcher/config, services/IPC and display APIs
  **before** trying to execute it in the research VM.
- Keep serial/graphics controls and prepared-image hashes intact. Earlier
  exFAT/archive/XML parser harness work is secondary to the real-UI goal.

## Repository and evidence discipline

The actual Git root is now **this project directory**. Both current remotes,
`ioniq` and `origin`, point to `https://github.com/JaredReabow/Ioniq-5.git`.
Re-query before future integration; the historical parent/Kona layout is stale.
Stage exact reviewed paths, never all of `work/`. No raw firmware, VM disks,
client key bytes or private-key material belong in this continuation's commit.

Primary current notes: `vendor-kernel-vm.md`, `vendor-kernel-graphics.md`,
`local-ui-recovery.md`. Historical exploit, downgrade, partition-map and
trust-pinning claims require their original scope and current-build validation.
No stock-to-root path, authentic payload decryption, bootloader acceptance of a
self-signed image, or hardware flashing has been demonstrated here.

## Public visibility follow-up — 2026-10-28

The sanitized `main` is `ea3fb24fb3af398963ebf17febbef392bb8bd6c3` on the verified `JaredReabow/Ioniq-5` remote. Current remote tree has no owner USB export, upstream raw dump, or frozen Council packet paths; the repository remains private. GitHub still resolves old raw commits `e98e2c8cd1fe477c735907b12c4c0b25976d19c4` and `692eccd380f3a791d800bb6c0ac6dc621af2585a` by SHA. GitHub Support ticket [#4916475](https://help.github.com/ticket/personal/0/4916475) requests server-side cached-view and object cleanup for both. Once GitHub confirms cleanup, verify both old commit IDs no longer resolve, rerun the public harness and unit suite, recheck the explicit remote tree and visibility, then make this same repository public and read back `PUBLIC`. Preserve the existing uncommitted local research and ignored private raw files; do not merge the old Git history into the sanitized branch.

## Security research session — 2026-10-30

- **V-006 dynamically confirmed in VM**: `work/vm/vendor-mtp` boots the vendor rootfs in the QEMU harness (EHCI `ich9-usb-ehci1`; vendor `xhci_pci` oopses on QEMU xHCI at `xhci_toggle_dis_perr_det` — use EHCI) with vendor udevd+dbus+`usb-automount`; guest needs esinit's `passwd.legacy -> /tmp/passwd` copy for dbus `messagebus` user. A `usb_device` add event with `ID_SERIAL_SHORT="pwn;id>/tmp/VM-PWNED"` + `ID_USB_INTERFACES=":060101:"` produced root code execution (`/tmp/VM-PWNED` = `uid=0(root)`, owner root; run `runs/mtp-1793362887`, evidence `serial-evidence-pwned.log`). Injection slot is **ID_SERIAL_SHORT (iSerialNumber)**, NOT ID_FS_LABEL — earlier notes corrected; full dossier `work/firmware-decrypted/V006-EXPLOIT.md`.
- Register extended (sanitized): V-006 status updated to VM-confirmed; V-008 clarified (console enabled by default every boot); new V-009 (launcher fail-open state gate), V-010 (engineering keypad static unsalted SHA-256 digests, values withheld), V-011 (world-writable marker files -> path units incl. forced reboot), V-012 (11 root services `EnvironmentFile=/tmp/session_appmgr.env` -> LD_PRELOAD class).
- Negative results (OBS): ApplicationManager `killall %1` not injectable (static table, int keys; `SUBAGENT-KILLALL-TAINT.md`); MediaBrowser popen = addr2line crash reporter; iAP2Service system() fixed `ifconfig ncm0 up`; udev `%k`/`%p` RUN+= injection not established (structured names); zero SUID/SGID; extraction-fidelity verified (4 analyzed files byte-identical to tar members via `cmp`).
- Root `shadow.Global` SHA-512 (salt `I6C6apC0ue`): no default candidate matched; community leads (xakcop LV2) are Android-platform, not applicable.
- **Update pipeline ordering CLOSED (OBS)** in `AppUpgrade.full.asm`: USB update = stage `MAINCONFIG.json` from USB zip -> `signFileVerify` (@0x54934, `updatedecrypt.cpp`) RSA-verifies against **`/app/share/AppUpgrade/teruten5_pub.key`** (bare DER RSA-2048, plain file on rw `/app`, shared with `AppScomoDM`/`AppDMClient`) -> only then `tar` extract -> `.lge.upgrade.xml` readConfiguration (per-file TE2 detect, `isKeyExist` -> TXE `fileDecryption` or legacy `getKeyFile` + `DecryptToPIPE | dd bs=512`) -> `HashCheck` (its "non-encryption!!" string is a log outcome, not a bypass switch). Unsigned packages abort ("The integrity check has not been confirmed.") -> legit USB path is signature-gated; anchor-swap = persistence layer (new sanitized register entry **V-013**). AppUpgrade's `unzip/cp/tar` helpers are Qt argv-style (no system/popen/posix_spawn imports) -> no injection there (INF).
- Notes: `work/firmware-decrypted/SUBAGENT-FINDINGS.md` §2/§5-8 all closed except on-hardware validation; `SUBAGENT-SURFACE.md` §7 is the top new lead. No commits made (user commits manually).

## VM bring-up session — 2026-10-31

State at the end of a long bring-up session, so the next person starts from here rather than from the beginning.

### What runs

- **Authentic boot chain**: `init=/lib/systemd/esinit` reaches **Multi-User System**. Two ordinary defects had to be
  fixed in a CoW clone, and both are vendor bugs worth separating from harness issues: `check-mount.sh` ships mode
  `0644` (no execute bit), and eleven `fstab` entries demand `mmcblk0pN` partitions the projection does not have
  (replaced with self-binds).
- **Our own Weston backend** (`ias-backend-soft.so`): vendor weston runs it with `ias-shell.so`, publishes
  `ias_crtc`/`ias_mode`, and `wrandr` reports `CRTC = 1, 1920x720 @ 60000`. The vendor's struct layouts differ from
  upstream 1.10 by `0x18` bytes in `weston_output`; `vendor-abi.patch` restores them. **Never build against upstream
  headers without it.**
- **EGL**: the image ships no software rasteriser at all. Injecting Debian `swrast_dri.so` + `libLLVM-3.9` and setting
  `LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH`/`MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=swrast` is what makes GL work.
- **Capture**: `ias-shot` (weston_screenshooter) plus a backend framebuffer dump; `--use-pixman` is mandatory, since
  the default renderer cannot read pixels back.
- **MICOM adaptor** (`micom-service`): owns `com.lge.car.micom` and answers the vehicle asks. This is what finally let
  `com.lge.avn.applauncher` register — the unit now logs `Started HKMC Preminum AVN 2.1 -Launcher`, which no earlier
  boot achieved.

### What is closed, and why

- **Rendered HMI**: the client commits surfaces and **never attaches a buffer**. Three interposition attempts failed for
  structural reasons: `wl_surface_commit` is a static inline wrapper nobody calls; `wl_proxy_marshal_array` is reached
  by an intra-DSO call that bypasses the PLT; and an `LD_PRELOAD` that hooks `wl_display_connect` kills the client.
  This needs vendor source or a binary patch, not another shim.
- **V-028 runtime execution**: four attempts (guessed signature, exact introspected signature, sequencing after the
  registry sweep with a pre-registered target, and with `ApplicationManager` pre-started) produced **no dispatch entry
  at all** — `appId[999]` never appears while the launcher loops on `appId[2]`. Established along the way: **no SMACK
  denial exists** in these boots. The static route stands; the runtime claim does not.

### Traps this session kept falling into

- A **zero** usually meant the code path never ran. Confirm the path was reached before reading the number.
- Guest writes do not persist (the drive is `snapshot=on`); move files out over a `-chardev file` serial port, which
  is the only lossless channel (console base64 corrupts above ~8 KB; the socket capture drops bytes).
- `debugfs` needs `set_inode_field <path> mode 0100755`; write mode is not preserved and an unexecutable wrapper fails
  silently.
- The launch path for a vendor service may be **D-Bus activation**, not its systemd unit. Intercepting the binary's own
  path covers every route at once — that is what finally worked for `micommanager_userspace`.
- The register is edited by several workstreams: cite entries by **title as well as number**.
