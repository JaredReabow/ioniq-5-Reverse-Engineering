# IONIQ 5 research history

This file is append-only. It records the IONIQ 5 research programme only.
The root `HISTORY.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` belong to the parallel Kona programme
and are not modified by IONIQ work.

## 2026-10-19 — project-directory consolidation

- Moved the complete IONIQ-owned project tree into `ioniq research/`, including
  the dedicated plan, ledger, history, changelog, evidence, Council review
  packages, test harness and analysis tools.
- Kept the IONIQ directory internally self-contained: paths such as
  `evidence/**`, `council/**`, `tests/**` and `tools/**` remain relative to the
  IONIQ project root.
- Preserved the separate Kona workspace, root `README.md`, root `HISTORY.md`
  and root `CHANGELOG.md` without modification.

## 2026-10-18

- Established the confidential IONIQ 5 research scope for the owner's 2021
  Australian NE1 in Daybreak Blue.
- Recorded the rule that vehicle research covers architecture, interfaces,
  evidence, and risk, while operational theft or live-intrusion procedures are
  outside scope.
- Accepted T1: the published Australian family is Standard Gen5W, model
  `NEAE.S5BLN.AAU`, with software `NE_E.AUS.S5W_L.001.001.260319` and map
  `AUS.19.41.47.011.611.0`. The installed build on the car remains unread.
- Catalogued the public method landscape as T3, separating Android `S5W_M`
  from Linux `S5W_L` and recording that many public recovery claims are author
  statements rather than proven restores.
- Accepted T4: the passive-to-bench route map, including owner-visible
  readback, official media metadata, dealer documentation, spare-unit work, and
  the separation of physical restoration from persistent software state.
- Accepted T5: the NE1 trust-zone and subsystem map, including the smart key,
  immobilizer, body controller, gateway, diagnostics, telematics, ADAS, chassis,
  VCU, BMS/HV, HVAC, camera/audio, and network domains.

## 2026-10-19

- Repaired and ran the official Hyundai Navigation Updater on macOS, moved an
  off-screen updater window back onto the primary display, and downloaded the
  official Australian 2021-23 IONIQ 5 package for read-only inspection.
- Confirmed the package identity: 36 files, 9,514,830,930 bytes, 35 manifest
  payload records, all sizes and IEEE/zlib CRC-32 values matching, a verified
  Australian map, two verified voice-resource MD5 values, and both front-key
  CRC-32/MPEG-2 values matching. The sorted-tree SHA-256 is
  `bc3013e5fc1499612cec76777aa736e0973a0b8a337c6619aace9af5a4d9652a`.
- Recorded that nineteen package files are high-entropy opaque envelopes, that
  six `*_sub` files are plaintext x86-64 Linux 4.1.27 IPK containers, and that
  no decryption, USB write, or vehicle action occurred.
- Accepted T2 after an independent review reproduced the inventory, digest,
  manifest records, MD5 values, and archive format checks.
- Accepted T7: `hmg_nemesis` is a real Android/TCC803x root path but is not an
  applicable method for this Linux `S5W_L` family; its Gate 4 and recovery
  limitations are transferable, its operational mechanism is not.
- Accepted the Council generation 10 review of frozen batch 8, fingerprint
  `9c410e07d2a130c967ac567f5e32788731c909ca2e2c684fc856fc8c3080198b`, with
  Astra, a labelled DeepSeek V4.1 Flash Grok replacement, and a labelled
  DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision Fable replacement all returning COMPLETE.
- Completed the T6 integration draft: `Ioniq5-research-plan.md` traces R1-R11
  to accepted evidence, covers every named vehicle subsystem, defines Phases
  0-8 with exit criteria, closes the T6 portion of ASTRA-G7-S01 through a
  four-part Gate 4 conjunction, and separates physical restoration from
  persistent software-state coverage.
- Added dedicated IONIQ history and changelog documents plus a root
  `.gitignore` that excludes firmware, package and extraction trees, dumps,
  captures, credentials, identifiers, and personal-data workspaces while
  retaining text evidence.
- Recorded that no live vehicle entry, diagnostic session, USB write, firmware
  flash, or actuation was performed. T6 review, staged-content verification,
  commit, and push to the private `Ioniq-5` repository remain coordinator
  actions.
- Revised the private-repository retention policy at the owner's request:
  firmware, extracted analysis trees, captures, device-specific dumps, vehicle
  identifiers, and analysis workspaces may now be deliberately committed. The
  downloaded 9.5 GB official package tree and live credentials/private keys
  remain excluded, and Kona-owned paths remain outside Ioniq commits.
- Corrected the active vehicle scope to the owner's UK-origin 2021 IONIQ 5 and
  selected the official European Standard Gen5W package
  `NE_E.EUR.S5W_L.001.001.260128`; retained the Australian package as comparison
  evidence rather than rewriting the earlier accepted record.
- Verified all 17 completed European payloads against their manifest CRC-32
  values and recorded the interrupted map-download state without deleting the
  11 GB cache.
- Repaired, ad-hoc signed and registered an isolated Navigation Updater copy,
  resumed the existing European cache through LaunchServices, and observed it
  rewrite interrupted segments and advance through new parts beyond `.z964`.
- Recovered all 64,923 kallsyms entries from the exact European x86-64 Linux
  4.1.27 kernel. Applied 25,068 names in Ghidra and decompiled 48 priority
  security functions, including the LG keystore and OEM-signature chain.
- Assessed published Gen5W root/application-loading methods against build
  `260128`. No public stock-to-root path is presently confirmed; published
  persistence, decryption and SSH components require prior execution.
- Added the interim EU/AUS byte comparison and region-transition gates. The
  Australian package is not established as a safe cross-region install.
- Completed the official European package: all 35 payload sizes and signed
  CRC-32 values match, the map and both voice MD5 sidecars match, and the
  36-file SHA-256 inventory digest is
  `f06752ea7cbf296ef7d7d7482f5ba96a3349161fc7ad0d60b36b042f62ef5b51`.
- Completed the EU/AUS file matrix: six of 32 common paths are byte-identical,
  nineteen are equal-size but byte-different, seven differ in size and bytes,
  and four paths are region-specific to each package.
- Confirmed that corresponding EU and AUS boot targets use the same x86-64
  Linux 4.1.27 kernel configuration but different kernel and signed-container
  bytes and different January/March 2026 build dates.
- Added a defensive custom-firmware and privileged-access feasibility report.
  It documents prerequisites, trust boundaries, published-method applicability
  and candidate audit surfaces without implementing an exploit, bypass,
  modified image, flash procedure or live vehicle action.

- 2026-10-28: Prepared a public-safe snapshot by removing the owner USB exports and upstream raw diagnostic dump from reachable Git history, anonymizing local user paths, and retaining only sanitized firmware findings. Publication remains gated on GitHub server-side cleanup of previously cached raw commits.

- 2026-10-28: Prepared an independent public repository from that sanitized
  snapshot with a fresh Git history. The earlier private repository and its
  unresolved historical objects remain separate. The public push is subject
  to the public privacy and Git-scope harness.
