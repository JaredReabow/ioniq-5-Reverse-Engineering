# DecryptToPIPE output-integrity checkpoint

## Status

Implementation, publication, and the later host-side LZ4 pipe-deadlock remediation are complete.

## Findings

- Canonical stock helper identity is bound directly from the canonical rootfs
  archive: size `559,192`, SHA-256
  `e3110811e83701368e638947e6d8887f59321707e70f6288adf0790090d929c0`,
  Build ID `4303e27a93f0acfb308146a5d034dafbffa064d0`.
- All six normal EU boot images select the `TE2` decryption path.
- All six plaintext `_sub` images select exact parser result `-404` and the
  raw-copy fallback.
- AppFUMO supplies fallback offset `0`.
- Both 512-byte stdout loops reject only negative writes; shorter nonnegative
  writes are not completed.
- Parser/decrypt/read/write results do not reach process exit; main returns zero
  after the stream call.
- AppFUMO independently discards the shell/pclose status and performs no final
  boot-destination byte verification.

- current report SHA-256 after rebinding the remediated matrix helper:
  `cd85dc09404e055ae84ce45f6483dc5ab276f4d61032fe491d79624564cb351d`;
- exact-static excerpt SHA-256:
  `ddfab55d2670e80d133490568207d42a46849d823837dc83139c55d8a2633f70`.

The matrix helper was later changed from `subprocess.run(input=..., stdout=PIPE)`
to explicitly concurrent bounded stdin/stdout/stderr draining. This avoids an
observed Python 3.13/macOS pipe deadlock without changing package bytes or report
semantics. The only deterministic report delta is the bound matrix-helper hash.

## Boundary

No recovered helper or target executable was run. No pipeline, `dd`, update,
modified image, mount, partition write, reset, boot operation, root action, or
persistence mechanism was created or executed. Runtime completeness, final
bytes, boot acceptance, health, mark-good, rollback, root and persistence remain
unknown.
