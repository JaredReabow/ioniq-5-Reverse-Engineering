# Disconnected bench state bundle checkpoint

Status: implemented, extended for FUMO relaunch, update-source policy state,
and process capability/persistence-gate capture; locally validated on 2026-11-08.

## Completed

- `tools/uk_fw/bench_state_bundle.py`
  - emits and statically audits a fixed, read-only POSIX-shell probe;
  - hex-frames every command/file record and suppresses unframed diagnostics;
  - limits process command lines to named daemons under review and filters the
    kernel command line to boot/trust fields plus a full-line SHA-256;
  - does not mount, start/stop services, alter radios, query modem control
    planes, contact network peers, signal processes, or write target files;
  - parses serial timestamps offline with exact section/schema/status/completion
    validation, 64 MiB capture and 8 MiB line/section bounds, and capture,
    section, and canonical-report hashes;
  - passively records FUMO mode and local-relaunch state
    (`disableEncryptionUpdate`, `disableNaviMapSignatureCheck_20230207`,
    `force_launch`, completion markers, update-directory metadata, staged
    AppUpgrade/XML hashes, and `/tmp/AppUpgrade`) without creating or changing
    any marker;
  - records `/dev/ptmx`, `/dev/pts`, and `/dev/pts/ptmx` metadata, including
    device major/minor identity, alongside the existing mount
    capture so configured PTY exposure can be separated from runtime state;
  - records `/proc/modules` and hashes exact `unix.ko` without loading it, so
    AF_UNIX static findings can be compared with observed module state;
  - passively inventories `/dev/mei{,0,1}`, shipped Intel MEI modules and
    module-load configuration, and `/sys/class/mei/*` metadata/device links/dev
    numbers/uevents without opening a MEI device, issuing an ioctl, writing
    sysfs, or sending a CSE message; this establishes host-interface presence
    only, not `/snowball` access or an authenticated client protocol;
  - passively inventories `/dev/tpm0`, `/dev/tpmrm0`, shipped TPM/CRB/TIS
    modules, and `/sys/class/tpm/tpm*` metadata/device links/dev numbers,
    version text, and uevents without opening a TPM node or issuing a TPM/PTT
    command; this supports TXE `3.1.50.2222` advisory triage but does not prove
    PTT ownership, key state, provisioning authority, or exploitability;
  - records the scalar `/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid` runtime policy
    without calling `perf_event_open`, running `perf`, creating an event, or
    starting a thread;
  - records metadata for `/update` and `/update/usb` in addition to the staged
    subdirectories, and performs read-only `getfattr` listing/value queries for
    `SMACK64` and `SMACK64EXEC` on the update namespace, staged updater/XML,
    installed AppDMClient/AppUpgrade, and persistent public key;
  - keeps absent path, absent attribute, unavailable xattr provider, query error,
    malformed label and successful label distinct, preserves raw records, and
    derives `facts.smack_xattrs` without reading staged file content;
  - records process real/effective/saved/filesystem uid/gid values and
    supplementary groups separately from the legacy real-id process summary;
  - records parent PID, inheritable/permitted/effective/bounding and optional
    ambient capability sets, optional `NoNewPrivs`, and `Seccomp` from one
    bounded status parse per observed process; Linux v4.1 does not expose
    `NoNewPrivs` in `/proc/PID/status`, so absence is recorded as unavailable
    rather than failing collection; the host report decodes Linux v4.1 capability
    names through `CAP_AUDIT_READ` and preserves unknown bits;
  - records read-only `kexec_load_disabled`, `modules_disabled`,
    `dmesg_restrict`, and `mmap_min_addr` values when exposed;
  - adds systemd, `esinit`, AppLauncher.sh, the update anchor, the stock relabel
    and SMACK setup scripts, `/bin/sh` and Bash, both loader pathnames, and fixed
    `/bin/date`/`/usr/bin/date` candidates to the passive hash/metadata set;
  - adds launcher-chain/systemd/relabel/SMACK-setup/anchor/interpreter/loader/
    fixed-command/`/tmp` `SMACK64` and `SMACK64EXEC` queries, without executing
    any recovered target or candidate utility;
  - extends static auditing to reject bare or path-qualified xattr, ownership and
    mode mutation utilities plus mutating `attr`/`setfattr` options;
  - distinguishes absent from unreadable/read-error state and fails the terminal
    completion verdict on failed reads, metadata/link queries, passive commands,
    or malformed/empty hash output.
- `tools/uk_fw/rootfs_patch.py`
  - rejects absolute/traversal/drive/backslash paths, normalized duplicates,
    links, FIFOs and device nodes;
  - confines injection destinations and refuses existing, in-place, symlink and
    hard-link-alias package/manifest outputs, including cross-aliases to the
    rebuilt package;
  - emits USTAR directly while preserving numeric uid/gid/mode/mtime and
    top-level dotfile names, independent of host ownership;
  - stages read-only directory modes without blocking descendant extraction.
- Updated the bench runbook, custom-firmware build note, handover, changelog and
  append-only history.

## Review corrections

The first review found incomplete-verdict, unframed-stderr, size-accounting,
hard-link, duplicate-directory, and read-only-directory defects. The second
found raw-line/conflicting-schema acceptance, `command -v` stdout, whole-capture
line splitting, top-level dotfile renaming, and a manifest/rebuilt cross-alias.
All are covered by regression tests. The final root review also changed package
and manifest outputs to exclusive new-file creation. The FUMO-state extension
received separate correction rounds for writer coverage, scoped relaunch claims,
provider failures, and terminal fail-closed semantics; the corrected diff was
independently accepted.

## Validation

```text
focused collector: 23 passed, 20 subtests passed
complete suite: 556 passed, 148497 subtests passed
public harness: PASS (pass=3, info=4, no pending/blocked/fail)
probe audit: safe=true, syntax_ok=true, violations=[]
probe size: 22464 bytes
probe SHA-256: c043f3ed5c1815897de8ee5faececd6c36a9cb36e24fabd83d43b7dab164fc56

```

The update-source policy extension includes focused tests for absent paths and
attributes, unavailable providers, query failures, malformed/successful labels,
complete process credential parsing, and bare/path-qualified mutation rejection.
The capability extension adds synthetic parser coverage for known, absent,
unknown, and malformed capability fields. Focused validation passed `25 tests,
20 subtests`; the complete suite passed `876 tests, 351661 subtests` in
`122.06s`. The emitted probe was 25,651 bytes with SHA-256
`5fc8ed5d80073ef8aa19fa3a82505d97db1e06baef33320c9c0aad94127d7c6b` at
that checkpoint.

The 2026-11-09 direct-chain evidence extension adds the anchor's complete
interpreter/loader objects, fixed `date` candidates, and relabel/setup scripts to
metadata/hash/xattr capture. Focused collector validation remains `25 passed, 20
subtests passed`; combined collector/readiness validation passed `40 tests, 22
subtests`, and the complete suite passed `906 tests, 351663 subtests` in
`127.79s`. The current emitted probe is 26,125 bytes with SHA-256
`ffecb19856528e01cf2ad81812d339e32913176094446b78f65714605babde8c`.
No physical unit, target network, radio, modem, firmware update, recovered
executable, or active exploit input was used.

The current passive MEI and TPM/PTT inventory extension adds only
character-node/module/sysfs metadata and bounded text reads; it never opens a
MEI or TPM endpoint or sends firmware traffic. Focused collector/readiness
validation passed `40 tests, 22 subtests`. The emitted probe is 27,726 bytes
with SHA-256
`1e74bc7464040653ef85a111226f9538a4ba70e73494ff499a5e1907e089b06a`;
its host-side audit reports `safe: true` and `syntax_ok: true`. The canonical
suite passed `1019 tests, 352351 subtests` in `178.62s`; canonical log SHA-256
is `3bac844aac12bef74489777f475c680108e56d6dfd7f941c106287dcd7ccc8e8`.

## Delegation/routing

- Fable route check failed because `openrouter/claude-fable-5.1` is not
  advertised for native subagents (`multi_agent_version != v2`). No router
  configuration was changed and no private target data was sent to Fable.
- DeepSeek Flash remained static-ready only and was not substituted.
- Generic read-only child reports:
  - `2f0cbd80-0a7d-4050-adc5-6c76bdaed852`: public update-system trust and
    offline acceptance model;
  - `1cc317d2-2adf-48c4-a384-06c9963cd44a`: passive collector design.
- Independent implementation review ran on the current selected model and
  returned two correction rounds; acceptance is based on the corrected diff and
  local regression evidence, not on route self-report.

## 2026-11-08 routing note

The requested `openrouter/claude-fable-5.1` native-subagent route remains
unavailable because it is not advertised with `multi_agent_version=v2`.
DeepSeek Flash also remains absent from the native catalogue. No substitute
model was used and no private target detail was sent externally. This bounded
read-only collector extension was completed locally rather than stalling the
offline research; it has focused local validation but no fresh independent
acceptance.

## Next exact actions

1. On return of an owner-controlled disconnected bench, emit/audit the probe,
   run it through an already-available console without copying it to storage,
   and parse the retained stdout before any active test.
2. Compare installed hashes/state with V-015 through V-020 and the recovered
   Dropbear conclusion; do not promote absence/denial/truncation to a negative.
   V-020-specific passive fields now cover BusyBox/unzip providers,
   AppLauncher/AppDMClient/AppScomoDM/AppUpgrade, `CarOption.csv`,
   `DecryptToPIPE`, the public key, effective arguments, uid, process SMACK
   labels, relaunch/completion markers, staged `/update/usb/bin` identities, and
   `SMACK64`/`SMACK64EXEC` state for the source namespace and trust subjects.
3. Use the captured A/B flags and current root only after a full partition dump
   and restore rehearsal to plan any update acceptance experiment.
4. Offline, continue exact `AppUpgrade` child analysis of descriptor semantics,
   TE2 metadata use, manifest-to-payload binding, version comparison, payload
   targets, inactive-slot writes, boot selection, and mark-good. AppScomoDM USB
   staging and its pre-auth BusyBox boundary are now separately documented.
