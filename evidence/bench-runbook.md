# Bench runbook: from unboxing to verified assessment

Status: operating procedure for the owner's Gen5W AVN on an isolated bench. Each
phase is read-first and gated: do not start a phase until the previous phase's
evidence exists. Tool paths are relative to this project root.

## Phase 0 — physical preparation

1. Photograph the board and all connectors; record silkscreen IDs and PCB revision.
2. Identify `ttyS2` pads (the console is configured in the recovered command
   line) and the USB service port.
3. Before applying power, confirm the unit is on an isolated supply and not
   connected to any vehicle harness.
4. Prepare a USB-UART adapter at **115200 8N1**.

Evidence to keep: photographs, pad map, adapter identity.

## Phase 1 — first boot, serial capture

```
python3 tools/uk_fw/bench_serial.py list
python3 tools/uk_fw/bench_serial.py capture --port <PORT> -o work/bench/boot.log
```

Record: boot loader banner, whether autoboot is interruptible, `ABL.oemkm=` presence,
the `esinit` handoff, and the login prompt. The command line recovered from the
package does **not** contain `ABL.oemkm=`; the boot loader appends it. Capture it.

If a boot loader prompt appears, stop and record `printenv` before changing
anything.

Evidence to keep: `boot.log`, a note of the exact `ABL.oemkm=` value observed.

### Phase 1A — one passive state bundle before active testing

Generate the probe on the analyst host and review it before use:

```sh
PY="${PYTHON:-$HOME/.platformio/penv/bin/python3}"
"$PY" tools/uk_fw/bench_state_bundle.py emit -o work/bench/state-probe.sh
"$PY" tools/uk_fw/bench_state_bundle.py audit work/bench/state-probe.sh
```

The emitted POSIX-shell program writes only to stdout. It does not mount,
remount, create target files, start/stop services, change radio state, contact a
network peer, signal processes, or capture credentials. Run it only after a
console is already available, retain stdout as `state.log`, then parse on the
host:

```sh
"$PY" tools/uk_fw/bench_state_bundle.py parse work/bench/state.log \
  --json work/bench/state.json
"$PY" tools/uk_fw/bench_candidate_triage.py work/bench/state.json \
  > work/bench/kernel-candidate-triage.json
"$PY" tools/uk_fw/bench_root_readiness.py work/bench/state.json \
  -o work/bench/root-readiness.json
"$PY" tools/uk_fw/bench_physical_root_readiness.py work/bench/state.json \
  -o work/bench/physical-root-readiness.json
"$PY" tools/uk_fw/bench_carplay_readiness.py work/bench/state.json \
  -o work/bench/carplay-readiness.json
```

This single capture records installed hashes, process uid/gid and effective
SMACK labels, real/effective/saved/filesystem uid/gid values, supplementary
groups, parent PIDs, inheritable/permitted/effective/bounding/ambient capability
sets, optional `NoNewPrivs`, `Seccomp`, unit activation, listeners, interfaces, passive
Wi-Fi/P2P state, oFono device/unit state, local Bluetooth SDP/profile state,
Dropbear chain completeness, and A/B/update flags. It also records the exposed
read-only values of `kexec_load_disabled`, `modules_disabled`,
`dmesg_restrict`, and `mmap_min_addr`. `/proc/PID/status` does not expose
securebits, so those remain a separate observation rather than being inferred
from capability masks. Linux v4.1 also does not normally expose `NoNewPrivs` in
that file; the collector records it as unavailable unless a vendor backport
provides it. For the newly bounded CSE trust questions, the same identity
section passively records metadata for `/dev/mei{,0,1}`, the shipped
`mei.ko`/`mei-me.ko`/`mei-txe.ko` files and module-load configuration, plus each
observed `/sys/class/mei/*` entry's metadata, device link, device-number text,
and device `uevent` text. It never opens a MEI character device, issues an
ioctl, writes sysfs, or transmits a firmware message. These records can identify
which host interface exists on a future disconnected bench; they do not expose
CSE `/snowball` storage, prove a client UUID, authenticate `ipub_key`, or permit
safe protocol interaction. For the exact TXE `3.1.50.2222` advisory boundary,
the collector also records metadata for `/dev/tpm0`, `/dev/tpmrm0`, shipped
TPM/CRB/TIS modules, and `/sys/class/tpm/tpm*` device links, dev numbers,
version text, and uevents. It never opens a TPM node or invokes `tpm2_getcap` or
another PTT command; these observations establish interface presence only, not
key ownership, provisioning state, anti-replay status, or exploitability.
Update-specific records include the live
command lines for AppLauncher/AppDMClient/AppScomoDM/AppUpgrade and hashes for
BusyBox, both unzip providers, those applications, `CarOption.csv`,
`DecryptToPIPE`, and `teruten5_pub.key`. For V-028 it also records
`Dbuslaunch.service`, `ApplicationLauncher.service`, AppLauncher uid/gid/SMACK
metadata, and file metadata only for `/tmp/session_appmgr{,.env}`. It does not
read or replay the private bus address, connect to the bus, inspect method state,
or send a launch request. It also records the FUMO relaunch and
completion markers; metadata for `/update`, `/update/usb`, `/update/sysroot`,
`/update/usb/upgrade`, and `/update/usb/bin`; and metadata/hashes for staged
AppUpgrade/XML and `/tmp/AppUpgrade`. Read-only `getfattr` listing/value queries
record `SMACK64` and `SMACK64EXEC` state for the update namespace, staged
updater/XML, installed AppLauncher/AppLauncher.sh/AppDMClient/AppUpgrade,
systemd, `/tmp`, the relabel/setup scripts, the direct-transition anchor,
`/bin/sh`/Bash, the dynamic-loader link and target, fixed `date` candidates, and
the persistent public key. The hash/metadata set includes those same
interpreter/loader/command/policy objects plus systemd, `esinit`, and
AppLauncher.sh. Symlinks remain explicit metadata records even though hashing
follows their current targets. These reads do not establish which `date` object a
non-default runtime `PATH` would select. Provider absence, path absence,
attribute absence, query failure, malformed
output, and successful labels remain separate records. It passively records
`/dev/ptmx`, `/dev/pts`, and
`/dev/pts/ptmx` metadata—including device major/minor numbers—plus
`/proc/mounts`, so intended UNIX98 PTY exposure can be separated from an
observed major-5/minor-2 runtime endpoint before any TTY testing. It also
records `/proc/modules` and the current `unix.ko` file hash. The host triage tool
keeps a loaded `unix` module name and a matching current file separate from the
unproved claim that the loaded bytes came from that file. Symlink metadata is
recorded separately from hash resolution. A positive triage gate still does not
establish an installed-kernel byte identity, race, UAF, corruption, or root.
For the exact CVE-2026-40225 physical-root candidate, it now also passively
records hashes and metadata for `scsi_id`, `v4l_id`, `systemd-udevd`, the four
reviewed udev rule files, and `debug-shell.service`; the read-only load/active/
unit-file state of `debug-shell.service`; and `/dev/tty9` metadata. The host
physical-root assessor compares only exact identities and character-device
`4:9` state. It does not execute either helper, emit a uevent, request a unit,
access the virtual terminal, or infer hardware byte delivery, root, or
persistence.
For the recovered CarPlay/iAP2 boundary, the same passive pass now records exact
hashes and metadata for both projection units, `iap2_mod.sh`, the projection
SMACK policy, `iAP2Service-2.0`, `AppProjection`, `mdnsd`, the iAP2/AirPlay/
CoreUtils/CarPlay libraries, and the three normal transport modules. It records
unit state, projection process command lines and credentials, parsed
`/proc/modules`, `/dev/mfd-iap2` and alternate `/dev/ttyIAP20` metadata and
SMACK labels, plus the already passive interface/listener inventory. The host
CarPlay assessor compares sixteen exact recovered identities and keeps the
active service/process/device/module prerequisites separate from an optional
port-7000 observation. It never opens either device, sends iAP2/AirPlay data, or
infers phone delivery, public-CVE applicability, code execution, unrestricted
root, or persistence.

Missing commands/files remain explicit records. Unreadable files, failed
reads/metadata queries/passive commands, and malformed hash output set a
nonzero terminal collection status; an incomplete or nonzero terminal marker
makes the JSON incomplete rather than silently treating a failed or truncated
serial capture as authoritative. The root-readiness assessor validates that
canonical report and keeps the configured label-transition gates separate from
capability possession, credential commitment, complete interpreter loading,
effective override, root, and persistence. Even a fully passing passive report
is not evidence that the anchor was invoked. Do not replace this generated probe
with an arbitrary script under the same filename.

## Phase 2 — network surface (only if the unit reaches a network)

```
python3 tools/uk_fw/net_surface.py --target <UNIT_IP> --authorised --json work/bench/network.json
```

Triage the captured version strings against `evidence/child-notes/06-daemon-fingerprint-triage.md`.
Do not send exploit traffic; capture versions and banners first.

## Phase 3 — storage acquisition (read-only)

Dump every readable partition before any write. Record per-partition SHA-256 and
a sorted-tree digest. This is the restore baseline; without it, later phases are
irreversible.

**The update system is A/B.** Files are written to the inactive partition and
`/etc/fstab` is rewritten at the end to boot it; the previous partition is left
in place. On a bench unit this is a real rollback path for a rootfs experiment:
if a modified rootfs fails to boot, restore `fstab` (or boot the other partition)
from the console. It is **not** a rollback path for a bad boot image — that image
is RSA-signed and will be rejected rather than rolled back.

Capture `/etc/fstab` and, if the `/update` partition is readable, its flag files
(`activeNaviPath`, `activeResourcePath`, `updateVersionInfo`,
`disableEncryptionUpdate`, `disableNaviMapSignatureCheck_20230207`,
`system_update_completed`, `force_launch`, and the system/firmware/scheduled
completion markers) to identify which of `mmcblk0p3` / `mmcblk0p5` is currently
active and whether a local updater relaunch is pending. Read only; do not create,
overwrite, or remove any marker.

```
# once a rootfs tree exists (extracted or mounted read-only)
python3 tools/uk_fw/dump_survey.py --root <ROOTFS> --json work/bench/rootfs.json
```

`dump_survey.py` reports accounts, empty-password accounts, setuid/setgid,
capabilities, SMACK policy files, systemd units, boot command line, debug nodes,
persistence paths and world-writable files.

Priority outputs:
- `/dev/keystore` mode and SMACK label (see the SMACK note: devtmpfs makes an
  unlabelled node default to `*`).
- `appnavi` / `AppNavi` launcher and `esinit`.
- SMACK rules, if any exist as files.

## Phase 4 — key capture and decryption

The rootfs and application payloads are AES-CBC-128. Nothing in the package or
in the public toolchain contains the key; it is produced by the unit's own
updater and handed to `DecryptToPIPE` at a **random `/tmp` path on every update**.
The documented capture relies on that:

1. Back up the genuine decryptor. It lives at
   **`/app/share/AppUpgrade/DecryptToPIPE`**. Copy it twice — to
   `DecryptToPIPE_OG` beside it and to the USB. Losing it means the unit can
   never update again.
2. Remount `/` read-write, install a patched copy (the public tooling calls it
   `DecryptToPIPE_FK`) in its place, remount read-only, reboot.
3. Trigger a normal update from USB. The unit invokes the decryptor as:
   `DecryptToPIPE -d /tmp/<32 hex> /media/usb/1/<model>/AppUpgrade 0`.
   The patched copy writes that temporary key file to the USB.
4. On finding a `*_key_*.der` on the USB, restore `DecryptToPIPE_OG`, remount
   read-only, reboot.

Then decrypt offline:

```
DecryptToPIPE -d <keyfile> <input> 0 > <output>
```

`DecryptToPIPE` is a glibc x86-64 binary; on a Mac it needs a Linux container (the
public image is Alpine plus `gcompat`). `tools/uk_fw/gen5w_decrypt.py` already
wraps this for a whole package.

Do not attempt to derive the key from the package: entropy, keystream and
block-equality tests already exclude an offline break.

## Phase 5 — component triage

With plaintext:

1. Record exact versions of `dnsmasq`, `hostapd`, `wpa_supplicant`, `BusyBox`,
   `dropbear`, `miniupnpd`, `OpenSSL` and the projection stack.
2. Map each to `evidence/child-notes/01-component-cve-corpus.md` and
   `06-daemon-fingerprint-triage.md`.
3. Hash `AppUpgrade`, `AppDMClient`, `micomd` and compare against the
   `211214`-era components described by CVE-2023-26243…26246.
4. Audit the update envelope parser and the iAP2/CarPlay handlers per
   `evidence/child-notes/07-usb-gadget-protocol-surface.md`.

## Phase 6 — boot image acceptance experiment
Only after a verified restore path exists.

```
python3 tools/uk_fw/ipk_tool.py verify <OEM_IMAGE>
python3 tools/uk_fw/ipk_tool.py resign <OEM_IMAGE> -o work/test-sub --key work/test-key.pem \
    --cmdline "root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait init=/bin/sh console=ttyS2,115200n8"
```

The question is what the loader does with a correctly formed but differently
signed container. Outcomes:

| Observation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Rejected, stock boots | Loader pins the OEM key (expected) |
| Accepted, shell appears | Loader trusts the embedded modulus — critical finding |
| Rejected with an integrity error | Signature covers content as characterised |

Record the exact console output in every case.

## Phase 7 — disclosure

Any confirmed defect goes to Hyundai PSIRT / KISA with a minimal reproducer.
Do not publish a working chain before the vendor has had a reasonable window.

## Gates

1. No write without a full dump and a rehearsed restore.
2. No vehicle connection at any point.
3. No network testing beyond the isolated AP.
4. Every claim bound to captured evidence, not inference.
5. The first gate for the public entry path is **downgrade**: the AppNavi USB
   install is only offered on unpatched builds, and the `>=` version check blocks
official downgrades on a stock unit. Establish whether `260128` offers it before
   planning anything downstream.

## If the public entry path becomes available

The documented sequence is: install a replacement `AppNavi` through Engineering
Mode, which runs `main_loop.sh` from USB root; copy `DecryptToPIPE` and
`decryption_key.der` to the USB; decrypt the OTA offline; patch the rootfs; and
keep every future official update patched. Community material describes SSH by
adding keys, running the public-key installer, and relaxing the template
condition, but that is **not sufficient on recovered EU `260128`**: the server/
multi-call executable, socket unit, host-key service/key, and enable links are
absent. Any bench plan must first prove an independently supplied complete SSH
chain and may not infer a listener from the template/key remnants. Record each
step's evidence; do not skip the key backup.

## What is already known going in

- Console: `ttyS2`, 115200 8N1; early console at MMIO `0xfc000000`.
- Boot container: RSA-2048 / PKCS#1 v1.5 / SHA-256 over header+payload+tag.
- OEM key manifest: firmware-provided, located by `ABL.oemkm=<size>@<phys>`.
- Update-package acceptance is decided in userland; the reviewed kernel OEM verifier has narrow keystore backup/migration consumers, while boot-container and loader trust are separate stages.
- Rootfs AES-encrypted; no offline key recovery.

#### From the parallel repository

The parallel lineage describes the same bench sequence with a smaller passive
capture set and different trust wording. Everything unique to it is retained
below.

<!-- disagreement: the parallel version names the loader-supplied kernel parameter `oemkm=<size>@<phys>` (and asks the operator to record "the exact `oemkm=` value"), while this version names it `ABL.oemkm=<size>@<phys>`. Both names are kept; a human should confirm the literal token emitted by the boot loader. -->

- Parallel wording: boot-loader manifest parameter `oemkm=<size>@<phys>`
  ("OEM key manifest: firmware-provided, located by `oemkm=<size>@<phys>`").

<!-- disagreement: the parallel version says "Firmware trust is a userland decision; the kernel only verifies manifests." This version says update-package acceptance is decided in userland while the reviewed kernel OEM verifier has narrow keystore backup/migration consumers, with boot-container and loader trust as separate stages. Both statements are kept. -->

<!-- disagreement: the parallel version documents SSH persistence as adding keys to /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys, running the shipped publickey installer and relaxing the dropbear@.service condition. This version records that this is not sufficient on recovered EU 260128 because the server/multi-call executable, socket unit, host-key service/key and enable links are absent. Both statements are kept: the parallel steps are the community description, the newer text is the recovered-image finding. -->

- Parallel SSH persistence sequence (community description): add keys to
  `/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys`, run the shipped public-key installer, and
  relax the `dropbear@.service` condition — recorded here as documentation of
  what the community material claims, not as a verified bench step.

- Parallel passive-capture set (superseded by Phase 1A above but not withdrawn):
  `boot.log`, the exact loader-supplied manifest parameter value, and, for the
  `/update` partition, `activeNaviPath`, `activeResourcePath`,
  `updateVersionInfo` and `system_update_completed` only. The newer Phase 1A
  bundle additionally covers `disableEncryptionUpdate`,
  `disableNaviMapSignatureCheck_20230207`, `force_launch`, the completion
  markers, uid/gid/SMACK state, unit activation, listener state, hashes and PTY
  metadata.

##### Parallel phase-1 record and known-going-in lines (verbatim)

Record line (parallel version):

```
Record: boot loader banner, whether autoboot is interruptible, `oemkm=` presence,
the `esinit` handoff, and the login prompt. The command line recovered from the
```

Package/boot-loader note (parallel version):

```
package does **not** contain `oemkm=`; the boot loader appends it. Capture it.

If a boot loader prompt appears, stop and record `printenv` before changing
anything.

Evidence to keep: `boot.log`, a note of the exact `oemkm=` value observed.
```

/update flag capture (parallel version):

```
(`activeNaviPath`, `activeResourcePath`, `updateVersionInfo`,
`system_update_completed`) to identify which of `mmcblk0p3` / `mmcblk0p5` is
currently active.
```

SSH persistence paragraph (parallel version):

```
keep every future official update patched. The SSH persistence path is to add
keys to `/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys`, run the shipped publickey installer and
relax the `dropbear@.service` condition. Record each step's evidence; do not skip
the key backup.
```

What is already known going in (parallel version):

```
- OEM key manifest: firmware-provided, located by `oemkm=<size>@<phys>`.
- Firmware trust is a userland decision; the kernel only verifies manifests.
```
