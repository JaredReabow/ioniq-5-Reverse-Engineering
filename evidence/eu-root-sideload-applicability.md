# European `260128` root and application-loading applicability

> **Recovery update:** later validated native TE2/xcrypt work recovered rootfs,
> GUI, AppNavi and other userspaces. The older encrypted-userland blocker and
> unit-derived-decryptor-only implication below are superseded for local VM work.
> Decryption still does not prove stock-device initial execution or update/boot
> acceptance. See current `HANDOVER.md` and `community-chat-leads.md`; no current

Status: published-method and exact-build static assessment. It is not an
operational live-vehicle exploit procedure.

| Mechanism | Function | Exact-build assessment |
|---|---|---|
| `navi_extended` / AppNavi replacement | Historical initial execution | Platform family matches Linux `S5W_L`; applicability to `260128` is unconfirmed and plausibly blocked by Engineering/SOP-version gating. |
| Engineering/dealer UI | Diagnostic UI | UI access alone is not root or code execution. |
| `update_decryptor` | Extract encrypted update content | Downstream tool requiring a unit-derived `DecryptToPIPE` and key material not shipped publicly. |
| `update-patcher` | Persistent modified-update workflow | Post-compromise mechanism requiring prior execution and a decrypted rootfs. Recovered FUMO has a marker-controlled `Unencryption` mode on the NE-style `-un:0` route, but complete package acceptance and owner applicability remain unproven; SCOMO production startup ignores the marker. |
<!-- disagreement: the parallel repository listed "acceptance of unencrypted updates" among this mechanism's requirements as if established, while this analysis records that complete package acceptance is unproven and that only the FUMO `-un:0` route honours the marker. Both are preserved; see `#### From the parallel repository` below. -->
| Gen5W Wi-Fi/SSH loop | Post-root access | Requires an already-installed replacement/main-loop mechanism. |
| CVE-2023-26243 through CVE-2023-26246 | Key disclosure and update signature/version-check bypasses | Demonstrated on `AE_E_PE_EUR.S5W_L001.001.211214`; patch status on `NE_E.EUR.S5W_L.001.001.260128` remains unknown. |
| NEMESIS | Android/TCC803x DSP-OTA helper chain | Current upstream commit `b0178ed95a217879e779750d7a28d9f6b677d06f` explicitly requires `S5W_M` Android with OTA support and says `S5W_L` is unsupported because it is a fundamentally different hardware/software combination. It is not directly applicable to this recovered Linux/x86-64 package. |
| Unsigned modules, kexec, devmem/kmem/kcore, debugfs | Kernel post-entry surfaces | Confirmed compiled into `260128`; no reachable unprivileged entry or permissive SMACK policy is established. |

No inspected public source establishes a stock-to-root path for exactly
`260128`. `navi_extended` is the only family-matched published initial-entry
design found, but its prerequisite is not proven on this release. The other
public components are decryption, persistence or remote-access tools used after
execution has already been obtained.

Application loading is native Linux/Qt deployment, not APK installation.
Published examples replace rootfs/application files and create systemd units.
The European `260128` rootfs, AppNavi and GUI userspaces have now been recovered
and inspected offline, so launchers, service identities, SMACK rules and
application-integrity checks can be assessed directly. That plaintext recovery
does not establish a stock-device initial entry, updater acceptance, boot trust,
or persistence.

Current NEMESIS provenance reinforces the platform boundary. At upstream commit
`b0178ed95a217879e779750d7a28d9f6b677d06f`, `README.md` SHA-256
`46cd3c7c76df75ea82e43067a957b5ba1a2349d24f56a47eb57017e1f06046e2`
requires Android `S5W_M` and explicitly rejects `S5W_L`. Its technical record
`01-DSP-OTA-troubleShooter.md`, SHA-256
`4548a537b03993c5d39a219b6b33240f22928dbc7306bf689ba13354d4b382af`,
binds the demonstrated path to Telechips TCC803x, Android 4.4.2 and firmware
family `260507`. Those are public observations on a different platform, not
static or runtime evidence for the recovered x86-64 Linux updater.

Decisive remaining checks are the AppNavi Engineering/SOP gate, the exact
`DecryptToPIPE` interface, userland installer checks, kernel-keystore
enforcement, SMACK policy and application-integrity checks.

The broader feasibility analysis is recorded in
`evidence/eu-custom-firmware-feasibility.md`. It separates the four required
stages—initial execution, privilege transition, persistence and recoverable
boot/update trust—and records defensive audit surfaces without implementing a
zero-day, bypass, modified image or live procedure.


#### From the parallel repository

The parallel copy of this document is otherwise identical: same heading, same table, same rows and same verdicts. The only differing cell is `update-patcher`, which the parallel copy stated as:

| `update-patcher` | Persistent modified update | Post-compromise mechanism requiring prior execution, decrypted rootfs and acceptance of unencrypted updates. |
